GLOBAL_PROMPT_OLD = """Act as a graduate data science professor.
I will give you a tool (XYZ).
Write **three distinct and realistic graduate-level data science project briefs** using the given tool XYZ.
Each project should be distinct, creative, and feasible for a graduate student to build over a semester.
Include:
- Title
- Difficulty: 1/2/3 (1 = easy, 2 = medium, 3 = hard; use each level **exactly once**)
- Project Idea: 5-6 lines explaining the goal and approach.
- Python libs - 4–6 packages used in the implementation
- Is it Free? - Yes/No with explanation.
- Relevant tool(XYZ) related Resource Links

**Strict Constraints**:
- Use **different data sources**, **problem domains**, or **ML tasks** across the 3 projects.- DO NOT reuse the same Bitcoin price API data or ML algorithm.
- Keep each project unique and useful.
- Do NOT repeat the same dataset or algorithm across projects.
- Use realistic, popular Python packages—no toy examples.
- Do not propose projects that require physical sensors or IoT devices or non-public data.
- All data used must be from current, active, **public APIs or open datasets** that are **free to use without paid plans or authentication tokens**.
- Do NOT use APIs that have been discontinued or are no longer free (e.g., Twitter API, Yahoo Finance API, Google News RSS, COVID19API).
- Prefer datasets available on Kaggle (active ones only), HuggingFace Datasets, open government APIs, or GitHub repositories.
- Mention the dataset name or source clearly.
- Do NOT mention surveys, forms for custom user data source collection.
- **Do NOT use A/B testing in ANY project**.
- Use **pre-trained models** for NLP or vision tasks — do not require training from scratch.
- If describing "real-time" detection or streaming scenarios, clarify whether the data is truly streamed or simulated using static datasets. Avoid vague claims like "as new data streams in" unless you're using actual real-time APIs or streaming platforms.
- You may simulate streaming by feeding one row at a time from a static dataset in a loop — but you must clearly state this and explain how it mimics real-time inference.
- Avoid projects that require **GPUs, multi-node clusters, or expensive cloud compute**.
- Do NOT propose large-scale deep learning training unless using transfer learning on a small dataset.
- Avoid real-time claims unless tool supports it.
- Do **not propose large-scale training of transformer models or deep learning systems** unless pre-trained models are used for lightweight inference or fine-tuning on small datasets.
- Avoid long texts or steps. Use concise, clear language.
- Every project MUST involve at least one clear machine learning task (e.g., classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, forecasting, topic modeling, summarization, etc.).
- Tools that focus on EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering, or visualization MUST still include ML — even if basic.
- Projects must go beyond just model acceleration or deployment; they must include an actual ML task, with data, training/fine-tuning (if needed), evaluation, and analysis.

**Avoid overuse of common topics**:
You may use common domains like housing prices, movie sentiment, traffic data. But, do not repeat these aggressively domains/toolkits across tools.

**Examples of overused combinations to avoid repeating**:
- Housing price prediction (e.g., Ames, Boston)
- Sentiment analysis on movie or product reviews
- Accident detection using traffic APIs
- Titanic or Iris EDA/classification
- Spam detection or SMS classification
- Cryptocurrency price alerts

Examples of variation:
- Different data sources: GraphQL, WebSockets, news APIs, order books
- Different ML tasks: Forecasting, anomaly detection, clustering, classification, transfer learning
Look at the example to get an idea of how it needs to look.

GLOBAL_PROMPT = """
Act as a graduate-level data science professor.
I will give you the name of a tool (XYZ).
Write a Description in 4-6 lines about what the tool is and its features in bullet points. Mention this only once in the output generated.
You must then generate a **project blueprint** that helps students build three realistic data science projects over a semester.
You must write the brief assuming the student only knows the name of the tool — you will decide everything else (domain, dataset type, ML task, etc.) in a technically feasible and pedagogically valuable way.

Your response must include:

1. **Difficulty** : 1/2/3 (1 is easy, 2 is medium, 3 is hard; use each level **exactly once**)
2. **Project Objective**: Clearly state the goal of the project and what is being optimized, predicted, or detected.

3. **Dataset Suggestions**: Suggest where to find datasets (e.g., Kaggle, HuggingFace, government portals, simulated data). But DO NOT provide the exact specific dataset name.

4. **Tasks**: Outline the key tasks of the project, each tailored to the tool. Describe each task in 1-2 lines high-level description in brief bullet point formats.

5. **Bonus Ideas (Optional)**: Extensions, baseline comparisons, or challenges students might attempt if they want to go further.

**Constraints**:
- Project should run on standard laptops or Google Colab.
- Do not propose projects that require physical sensors or IoT devices or non-public data.
- All data used must be from current, active, **public APIs or open datasets** that are **free to use without paid plans or authentication tokens**.
- Do NOT use APIs that have been discontinued (e.g., Yahoo Finance API).
- Prefer datasets available on Kaggle (active ones only), HuggingFace Datasets, open government APIs, or GitHub repositories or APIs with a free tier.
- Do NOT mention surveys, forms for custom user data source collection.
- Use pre-trained models if deep learning is involved.
- Avoid overused examples like Titanic or Iris.
- Avoid vague real-time claims unless well-justified.
- Every project MUST involve at least one clear machine learning task (e.g., classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, forecasting, topic modeling, summarization, etc.).
- Tools that focus on EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering, or visualization MUST still include ML — even if basic.
- Projects must go beyond just model acceleration or deployment; they must include an actual ML task, with data, training/fine-tuning (if needed), evaluation, and analysis.
- Avoid vague statements like "scrape social media" — be specific and realistic.


Write in a way that is **student-friendly**, technically clear, and encourages learning and creativity.
Refer to the example below for some ideas.


EXAMPLE = Description

In this project, students will leverage TextBlob, a Python library for processing textual data, to perform real-time sentiment analysis on news articles related to Bitcoin. By integrating NewsAPI, students can access a wide range of news sources to gather relevant articles. The objective is to understand market sentiments and trends associated with Bitcoin prices and explore how this sentiment data can be utilized in time-series analysis for predictive modeling.
Technologies Used
TextBlob

    Simplifies text processing tasks with intuitive functions and methods.
    Utilizes NLTK and Pattern libraries for comprehensive NLP capabilities.
    Provides sentiment analysis returning:
        Polarity (from -1.0 to 1.0)
        Subjectivity (from 0.0 to 1.0)
    Supports multiple languages for global data processing.

NewsAPI

    Access to news articles from over 30,000 worldwide sources via HTTP REST API.
    Filters articles based on keywords, sources, language, and dates.
    Offers a free tier suitable for educational, non-commercial projects.

Project Objective

Create a pipeline to:

    Ingest real-time Bitcoin news using NewsAPI.
    Analyze sentiment with TextBlob.
    Integrate sentiment scores with Bitcoin price data for predictive time-series analysis.

Tasks

    Set Up NewsAPI Client:
        Register for API key at [NewsAPI.org].
        Use the newsapi-python client library.

    Ingest News Data:
        Fetch Bitcoin-related articles.
        Store articles and metadata (date, source) in a Pandas DataFrame.

    Perform Sentiment Analysis:
        Calculate polarity and subjectivity scores for each article.
        Aggregate sentiment scores (daily/hourly) to identify trends.

    Integrate with Bitcoin Price Data:
        Obtain Bitcoin price data via public APIs (e.g., CoinGecko).
        Align sentiment scores with price data based on timestamps.

    Time-Series Analysis:
        Implement forecasting models (ARIMA, LSTM) using sentiment scores.

    Visualization:
        Visualize correlations between sentiment trends and Bitcoin prices using Matplotlib or Seaborn.

Useful Resources

    [TextBlob Documentation]
    [NewsAPI Python Client Library]

Cost

    TextBlob: Open-source, free.
    NewsAPI: Free tier available for educational purposes (usage limits apply).
