* Sorrentum: Financial Machine Learning

- **Financial ML is very different than "traditional" ML**
- **Problems**
  - Non stationarity
  - Fat-tails (vs Gaussianity)
  - Small data sets
  - Enormous amount of noise
  - No way to run experiments (vs A/B testing)
    - One single realization of the universe
  - Decisions are made collectively by millions of individuals
    - Non-completely rationally
    - Behavioral biases and fallacies
    - Markets are influenced by emotions, fear, and greed

**Traditional ML**
Hit rate: 80%
R^2: 70%

**Financial ML**
Hit rate: 51%
R^2: 0.1% (10bps)

* Blockchain

- **Replicated, shared, synchronized data based on consensus**
  - Multiple parties can operate on data without trusting *each other* or *a central authority*
  - Permission-less (public) vs permissioned (private)
  - Intuition: a distributed append-only immutable ledger as a database
- **Consensus algorithm**
  - Multiple peer nodes replicate and update a copy of the data independently
  - Rules to determine what blocks become part of the blockchain
    - Proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake
  - Lack of central authority
    - No single point of failure
  - Designed to be resistant to malicious tampering
    - Up to a certain bound (e.g., 51% attack)
- **Example of blockchain + consensus algorithms**
  - Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano

* Smart Contract

- **Smart Contract / Protocol**
  - A computer program that automatically executes and controls actions according to the terms of a contract
- **What to trust? What is trust?**
  - Based on law (e.g., US currency is legal tender, fiat currency)
  - Based on social costumes (e.g., when you are in line at post office)
  - Based on math / code
    - Trust is in the infrastructure
    - Code is open source
    - Code and data is immutable (i.e., blockchain)
    - Trust that it's unlikely to hijack 51% of the nodes
  - Example:
    - A vending machine (can you really trust it?)
    - Bitcoin protocol, Ethereum smart contracts (you can trust it!)
- **Nodes maintain / update state on a blockchain**
  - Reduce need for trusted intermediaries
  - Reduce malicious and accidental exceptions
- Bitcoin = a special-purpose blockchain / smart contract
  - First application was money
- Ethereum = a blockchain for general-purpose smart contracts
  - Turing-complete
  - EVM

* DApps and DAO

- **Decentralized Applications**
  - Aka DApp, dApp, Dapp, dapp
  - Operate autonomously (without human intervention) using smart contracts running on a blockchain
  - Are not owned by any entity
  - Use tokens to represent ownership and incentivize behaviors
    - Aka tokenomics
  - Typically open-source
    - You can do an (hostile) fork, in the old meaning of creating a competing project
- **Decentralized Autonomous Organization**
  - DAO
  - Company with rules encoded in a contract
  - Transparent
  - Controlled by the organization's members through governance token
  - No centralized leadership
  - Not influenced by central government
  - E.g., Uniswap

* Current Financial System is Failing

- **Our financial system has not substantially changed over the past century**
  - Banks, brokers, exchanges, insurance companies, central monetary authorities
- **One revolution was digitization**
  - On-line banking
- In 2008 bailouts of the very institutions that caused the crisis
- In 2024 (55 years after the man was on the moon)
  - 3% for a credit card swipe to an oligopoly of companies
  - Saving rates are 0 or negative
  - A wire transfer takes 2-3 business days
  - Banks are closed on weekends
  - The government decides what you can or cannot do with your own money (e.g., accredited investors)
  - The government can fund wars with your tax money
  - Inflation is rampant around the world
  - There are 1.7b people in the world that have no access to banking system

* Decentralized Finance
- **Idea: instead of renovating a crumbling financial system, rebuild it from the ground up**
  - Offer financial instruments without relying on intermediaries (e.g., brokerage, exchanges, banks)
  - Replace old crap with dApps and smart contracts running on blockchain
- **The bright side**
  - No layers of bureaucracy
  - No middle-man taking commissions
  - No delay
  - Interoperability between services
  - Transparency
  - Equality (no special treatments or bribes)
- **The dark side**
  - Scams, greed, stupidity, rabbid speculation -> bubbles + bankruptcies
  - Do not learn from the past and make the same mistakes
  - As humans it seems that we can't help ourselves
- **My take: the impact of Web3 / Defi will be as big as the Internet**
  - From free information (Internet) to free society (Web3)
  - Put society and democracy on the blockchain
  - Get rid of rent-seeking tech companies
  - You can't defeat economy as you can't defeat gravity
