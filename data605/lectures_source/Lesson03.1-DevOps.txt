* Application Deployment
- For (almost all) Internet companies, **the application is the business**
  - If the application breaks, the business stops
  - E.g., Amazon, Google, Facebook, online banks, travel sites, ...

- **Problem**
  - Release, deploy, manage, monitor applications

- **Solutions**
  - Before 2000s: "bare-metal era"
  - 2000s-2010s: "virtual machine era"
  - After ~2013: "container era"

* DevOps

:::columns
::::{.column width=65%}
- **DevOps** = practices combining:
  - Software development (_dev_)
  - IT operations (_ops_)

- **Containers revolutionized DevOps**
  - Enable independence between app development and IT ops
    - One team creates an app
    - Another team deploys and manages apps
  - Foster collaboration and innovation
    - IT: "It doesn't work!"
    - Devs: "What? It works for me!"

* Run on bare metal
:::columns
::::{.column width=80%}
- **< 2000s**
  - Running few applications per server (no virtualization)

- **Pros**
  - No virtualization overhead

- **Cons**
  - Insecure due to no application separation
  - Expensive

- **Expensive / low efficiency**
  - New server for each application
  - Hard to spec machines $\to$ buy "big and fast servers"
    - Overpowered servers at 5-10% capacity
    - Significant spending during the 2000 DotCom boom on machines and networks

- Resurfaced in 2020 with different Cloud Computing use cases

- **Winners**: Cisco, Sun Microsystems, Microsoft

* Virtual Machine Era
:::columns
::::{.column width=75%}
- **Circa 2000-2010: Virtual Machine**
  - Run multiple OS copies on the same hardware

- **Pros**
  - Run multiple apps safely on one server
  - Use existing servers with spare capacity

- **Cons**
  - Each VM needs an OS (wastes CPU, RAM, disk)
  - Buy OS license
  - Monitor and patch each OS
  - Slow boot times

- **Winners**: VMWare, RedHat, Citrix

* Containers Era
:::columns
::::{.column width=60%}
- **Circa 2013: Docker becomes ubiquitous**

- **Docker**
  - Didn't invent containers
  - Made containers simple and mainstream

- Linux supported containers
  - Kernel namespaces
  - Control groups
  - Union filesystems

- **Pros**
  - Containers are fast and portable
  - Don't require a full OS
  - All run on a single host
  - Reduce OS licensing costs
  - Reduce OS patching and maintenance

- **Cons**
  - CPU overhead
  - Toolchain to learn / use

- **Winners**: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google (not Docker Inc.)

* Serverless Computing
- **Containers run in an OS, OS runs on a host**
  - **Where is the host running?**
    - Local (your laptop)
    - On-premise (your computer in a rack)
    - Cloud instance (e.g., AWS EC2)
  - **How is the host running?**
    - On a bare-metal server
    - On a virtual machine
    - On a virtual machine running on a virtual machine

- **Serverless computing**
  - Application runs without concern for _"how"_ or _"where"_
  - E.g., AWS Lambda

* HW vs OS Virtualization
:::columns
::::{.column width=55%}

- **Hypervisor performs HW virtualization**
  - Carves physical hardware into VMs
  - Allocates CPUs, RAM, and storage to a VM
  - Like having multiple computers

- "Virtual machine tax"
  - Running 3 apps requires 3 VMs
    - Each VM takes time to start
    - Consumes CPU, RAM, and storage
    - Needs an OS license
    - Requires admins and patching
  - You just want to run 3 apps!

\vspace{1cm}
- **Containers perform OS virtualization**
  - It's like having multiple isolated environments within the same OS

* Docker: Client-Server

:::columns
::::{.column width=55%}
- Docker relies on a **client-server architecture**

- **Docker client**
  - Command line interface
  - Communicates with the server through an IPC socket
    - E.g., `/var/run/docker.sock` or IP port

- **Docker engine**
  - Runs and manages containers
  - Modular, built from OCI-compliant subsystems
    - E.g., docker daemon, `containerd`, `runc`, plugins for networking and
      storage

* Docker Architecture

:::columns
::::{.column width=60%}
- **Docker runtime**
  - `runc`: Start and stop containers
  - `containerd`
    - Pull images
    - Create containers, volumes, network interfaces

- **Docker engine**
  - `dockerd`
    - Expose remote API
    - Manage images, volumes, networks

- **Docker orchestration**
  - `docker swarm`
    - Manage clusters of nodes
    - Often replaced by Kubernetes

- **Open Container Initiative (OCI)**
  - Standardize low-level components of container infrastructure
  - E.g., image format, runtime API
  - Evolution of Docker standards

* Docker Container

- **Docker Container**
  - Unit of computation
  - Lightweight, stand-alone, executable software package

- **Includes everything needed to run**
  - Code
  - Runtime/system libraries
  - Settings

- **Run-time object**
  - Docker images are build-time objects
  - Like program running (container) vs program code (image)

* Docker Image
- **Docker Image**
  - Unit of deployment

- **Contains everything needed to run an app**
  - Application code
  - Application dependencies
  - Minimal OS support
  - File system

- Users can
  - Build images from Dockerfiles
  - Pull pre-built images from a registry

- Multiple layers stacked
  - Typically a few 100s of MBs

* Docker Image Layers
:::columns
::::{.column width=60%}
- **Docker image** is a configuration file listing layers and metadata
  - Composed of read-only layers
  - Each layer is independent
  - Each layer comprises many files

- **Docker driver**
  - Stacks layers as a unified filesystem
  - Implements copy-on-write behavior
  - Files from top layers can obscure files from bottom layers

- **Layer hash**
  - Each layer has a hash based on content
  - Layers are pulled and pushed in a compressed format

- **Image hash**
  - Each image has a hash
  - Hash is a function of the config file and layers
  - Image changes generate a new hash

* Docker: Container Data
- A container has access to different data

- **Container storage**
  - Copy-on-write layer in the image
  - Ephemeral (temporary data)
  - Data persists until the container is removed
    - Stopping or pausing a container doesn't lose data
  - Containers are immutable
    - Avoid writing persistent data into containers

- **Bind-mount a local dir**
  - Mount a local directory to a directory inside a container

- **Docker volumes**
  - Volumes exist separately from the container
    - E.g., store PostgreSQL DB content
  - State is permanent across container invocations
  - Shareable across containers

* Docker Repos
:::columns
::::{.column width=55%}
- **Docker Repo (Registry)**
  - E.g., DockerHub, AWS ECR
  - Store Docker images
    - `<registry>/<repo>:<tag>`
    - E.g., `docker.io/alpine:latest`
  - Some repos are vetted by Docker
  - Unofficial repos shouldn't be trusted
  - E.g., https://hub.docker.com/
