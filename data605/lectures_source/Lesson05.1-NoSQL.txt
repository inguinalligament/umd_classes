* From SQL to NoSQL
:::columns
::::{.column width=70%}
- **DBs are central tools to big data**
  - New applications, data/storage constraints
  - ~2000s NoSQL "movement" started
    - Initially "No SQL" $\to$ then "Not Only SQL"

- **Different DB types make different trade-offs**
  - Different worldviews
  - Schema vs schema-less
  - Rich vs fast query ability
  - Strong consistency (ACID), weak, eventual consistency
  - APIs (SQL, JS, REST)
  - Horizontal vs vertical scaling, sharding, replication
  - Indexing vs no indexing
  - Tuned for reads or writes, control over tuning

- **User base/applications have expanded**
  - Postgres + Mongo cover 99% of use cases
  - Data scientists/engineers need familiarity with both
  - _"Which DB solves my problem best?"_

- **Polyglot model**
  - Use more than one DB per project
  - Relational DBs won't disappear soon

* Issues with Relational Dbs

- **Relational DBs have drawbacks**
  1) Application-DB impedance mismatch
  2) Schema flexibility
  3) Consistency in distributed set-up
  4) Limited scalability

- For each drawback a slide with:
  - **Problem**
  - **Solutions**
    - Within relational SQL paradigm
    - With NoSQL approach

* 1) App / DB Impedance Mismatch: Problem

- **Mismatch between data representation in code and relational DB**
  - Code uses:
    - Data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets)
    - Objects
  - Relational DB uses:
    - Tables (entities)
    - Rows (instances of entities)
    - Relationships between tables

- **Example of app-DB mismatch**:
  - Application stores a Python dictionary
    \begingroup \footnotesize
    ```python
    # Store a dictionary from name (string) to tags (list of strings)
    tag_dict: Dict[str, List[str]]
    ```
   \endgroup
  - Relational DB needs 3 tables:
    - `Names(nameId, name)` for keys
    - `Tags(tagId, tag)` for values
    - `Names_To_Tags(nameId, tagId)` to map keys to values
  - Denormalize using a single table:
    - `Names(name, tag)`

* 1) App / DB Impedance Mismatch: Solutions

- **Ad-hoc mapping layer**
  - Translate objects and data structures into DB model
    - Implement "Name to Tags" storage
    - Code uses a simple map, DB has 3 tables
  - Cons
    - Requires writing and maintaining code

- **Object-relational mapping (ORM)**
  - Pros
    - Automatic data conversion between object code and DB
    - Implement `Person` object using DB
    - Use SQLAlchemy for Python and SQL
  - Cons
    - Handling complex types, polymorphism, and inheritance can be challenging

- **NoSQL approach**
  - No schema
    - Objects can be flat or complex (e.g., nested JSON)
    - Stored objects (documents) can vary in structure

* 2) Schema Flexibility

- **Problem**
  - Data may not fit into a schema
  - E.g., nested or dis-homogeneous data (`List[Obj]`)

- **Within relational DB**
  - Use a general schema covering all cases
  - Cons
    - Complicated schema with implicit relations
    - Sparse DB tables
    - Violates relational DB assumptions

- **NoSQL approach**
  - E.g., MongoDB does not enforce schema
  - Pros
    - No schema concerns when writing data
  - Cons
    - Handle various schemas during data processing
    - Related to ETL vs ELT data pipelines

* 3) Consistency in Relational DBs
:::columns
::::{.column width=65%}

- **All systems fail**
  - Application error (corner case, internal error)
  - Application crash (OS issue)
  - Hardware failure (RAM ECC error, disk)
  - Power failure

- **Relational DBs enforce ACID properties**
  - Guarantee for system reliability

- **Atomicity**
  - Transactions are "all or nothing"
  - Transaction succeeds completely or fails

- **Consistency**
  - Transaction moves DB from one valid state to another
  - Maintain DB invariants (primary, foreign key constraints)

_Hardware failure_
::::
:::

- **Isolation**
  - Concurrent transactions yield the same result as sequential execution

- **Durability**
  - Committed transaction content preserved after system failure
  - Record data in non-volatile memory

* 3) Consistency in Distributed DB
:::columns
::::{.column width=70%}

- Scale data or clients $\to$ **distributed setup**

- **Goals**:
  - Performance (transactions per second)
  **- Availability (up-time guarantee)
  - Fault-tolerance (recover from faults)

- **Achieving ACID consistency:**
  - _Not easy_ in single DB
    - E.g., PostgreSQL guarantees ACID
    - E.g., MongoDB doesn't
  - _Impossible_ in distributed DB
    - Due to CAP theorem
    - Even weak consistency is difficult

* CAP Theorem
:::columns
::::{.column width=45%}

- **CAP theorem**: Any distributed DB can have at most two of the following
  - **Consistency**:
    - All clients see the same data
    - Writes are atomic; subsequent reads retrieve the new value
  - **Availability**: Returns a value if at least one server is running
  - **Partition tolerance**: The system works even if communication is
    temporarily lost (network is partitioned)
::::
::::{.column width=50%}
![](data605/lectures_source/images/lecture_5_0/lec_5_0_slide_12_image_1.png)
::::
:::

- Originally a conjecture (Eric Brewer)
  - Proved formally (Gilbert, Lynch, 2002)

* CAP Corollary
:::columns
::::{.column width=45%}

- **CAP Theorem**: pick 2 among consistency, availability, partition tolerance

- **Network partitions**
  - Cannot be prevented in large-scale distributed systems
  - Can be reduced in probability using redundancy and fault tolerance

- You must sacrifice either:
  - **Availability**
    - Allow system downtime
    - E.g., banking system
  - **Consistency**
    - Allow different system views
    - E.g., social network

* CAP Theorem: Intuition
:::columns
::::{.column width=70%}

- Consider:
  - Client (_Node0_)
  - Two DB replicas (_Node1_, _Node2_)

- **Network partition occurs**
  - DB servers (_Node1_, _Node2_) can't communicate
  - Users (_Node0_) access only one (_Node2_)
  - _Reads_: Access data on the same partition
  - _Writes_: Can't update due to potential inconsistency
::::
::::{.column width=25%}
![](data605/lectures_source/images/lecture_5_0/lec_5_0_slide_14_image_1.png)
::::
:::

- **CAP theorem**: Sacrifice consistency or availability

- **Available, not consistent**
  - Inconsistency acceptable (e.g., social networking)
  - Allow updates on accessible replica

- **Consistent, not available**
  - Inconsistency unacceptable (e.g., banking)
  - Stop service to maintain consistency

* Replication Schemes
:::columns
::::{.column width=60%}

- **Replication schemes**: Organize multiple servers for a distributed DB

- **Primary-secondary replication**
  - Application communicates with the primary
  - Replicas require the primary for updates
  - Single point of failure

- **Update-anywhere replication**
  - Aka "multi-master replication"
  - Every replica can update data, which is propagated to others

- **Quorum-based replication**
  - _N_: Total replicas
  - Write to _W_ replicas
  - Read from _R_ replicas, pick the latest update (timestamps)

* Synchronous Replication
:::columns
::::{.column width=50%}

- **Synchronous replication**: updates propagate to replicas in a single
  transaction

- Implementations
  - **2-Phase Commit (2PC)**: original method
    - Single point of failure
    - Can't handle primary server failure
  - **Paxos**: widely used
    - No primary required
    - More fault tolerant
  - Both are complex/expensive

::::
::::{.column width=45%}
![](data605/lectures_source/images/lecture_5_0/lec_5_0_slide_16_image_1.png)
::::
:::

- **CAP theorem**: only one of Consistency or Availability can be guaranteed
  during a network partition
  - Many systems use relaxed consistency models

* Asynchronous Replication
:::columns
::::{.column width=50%}

- **Asynchronous replication**
  - Primary node updates replicas
  - Transaction completes before replicas update
  - Quick commits, less consistency

- **Eventual consistency**
  - Popularized by AWS DynamoDB
  - Consistency only on eventual outcome
  - "Eventual" may mean after server/network fix
::::
::::{.column width=45%}
![](data605/lectures_source/images/lecture_5_0/lec_5_0_slide_17_image_1.png)
::::
:::

- **"Freshness" property**
  - Read from replica may not be latest
  - Request version with specific "freshness"
    - E.g., "data from not more than 10 minutes ago"
    - E.g., show airplane ticket price a few minutes old
  - Replicas use timestamps for data versioning
  - Use local replica if fresh, else request primary node

* 4) Scalability Issues with RDMS: Problem

- Sources of SQL DB scalability issues:

1) **Locking data**
    - DB engine locks rows/tables for ACID
    - When locked higher latency $\to$ Fewer updates/second $\to$ Slower
      application

2) **Worse in distributed set-up**
  - Requires data replication over multiple servers (scaling out)
  - Slower application due to:
    - Network delays
    - Locks across networks for DB consistency
    - Overhead of replica consistency (2PC, Paxos)

* 4) Scalability Issues with RDMS: Solutions
:::columns
::::{.column width=70%}

- **Table denormalization**
  - Increase performance by adding redundant data
  - Pros
    - Faster reads: Lock one table, no joins
  - Cons
    - Slower writes: More data to update
    - Loss of table relations
- **Relax consistency**
  - Compromise on ACID
  - Weaken consistency (e.g., eventual consistency)

- **NoSQL**

* NoSQL Stores

- **Use cases of large-scale web applications**
  - Real-time access with ms latencies
    - E.g., facebook: 4ms for reads
  - No need for ACID properties
  - MongoDB started at DoubleClick (AdTech), acquired by Google

- **Solve problems with relational databases**
  - Application-DB impedance mismatch
  - Schema flexibility
  - Consistency in distributed setup
  - Scalability

- **To scale out, give up something**
  - Consistency
  - Joins
    - Most NoSQL stores don't allow server-side joins
    - Require data denormalization and duplication
  - Restricted transactions
    - Most NoSQL stores allow single-object transactions
    - E.g., one document/key
