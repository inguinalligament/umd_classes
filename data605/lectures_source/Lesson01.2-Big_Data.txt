**Instructor**: Dr. GP Saggese, [gsaggese@umd.edu](gsaggese@umd.edu)

* Data Science
- **Promises of data science**
  - Give a competitive advantages
  - Make better strategic and tactical business decisions
  - Optimize business processes

- **Data science is not new**, it was called:
  - Operation research (~1970-80s)
  - Decision support, business intelligence (~1990s)
  - Predictive analytics (Early 2010s)
  - ...

- **What has changed**
  - Now learning and applying data science is _easy_
    - No need for hiring a consulting company
  - Tools are _open-source_
    - E.g., Python + pydata stack (numpy, scipy, Pandas, sklearn)
  - _Large data sets_ available
  - _Cheap computing_
    - E.g., cloud computing (AWS, Google Cloud), GPUs

* Motivation: Data Overload
- _"Data science is the number one catalyst for economic growth"_
  (McKinsey, 2013)
- **Explosion of data in every domain**
  - Sensing devices/networks monitor processes 24/7
    - E.g., temperature of your room, your vital signs, pollution in the air
  - Sophisticated smart-phones
    - 80%+ of the world population has a smart-phone
  - Internet and social networks make it easy to publish data
  - Internet of Things (IoT): everything is connected to the internet
    - E.g., power supply, toasters
  - Datafication turns all aspects of life into data
    - E.g., what you like/enjoy turned into a stream of your "likes"
- **Challenges**
  - How to handle the increasing amount data?
  - How to extract actionable insights and scientific knowledge from data?

- **Petabyte** = 1000 TB
  - 13 years of HD video
  - \$250k/year on AWS S3
::::
:::: {.column width=50%}
- **Exabyte** = 1M TB
  - Global yearly Internet traffic in 2004
- **Zettabyte** = 1B TB = $10^{21}$ bytes

  - Fill 20% of Manhattan, New York with data centers
- **Yottabytes** = $10^{24}$ bytes
  - Yottabyte costs \$100T

* Big Data Applications: Marketing
- **Personalized marketing**
  - Target each consumer individually
  - E.g., Amazon personalizes suggestions using:
    - Shopping history
    - Search, click, browse activity
    - Other consumers and trends
    - Reviews (NLP and sentiment analysis)
- **Brands want to understand customer-product relationships**
  - Use sentiment analysis from:
    - Social media, online reviews, blogs, surveys
  - Positive, negative, neutral sentiment
- E.g.,
  - In 2022, \$600B spent on digital marketing

* Big Data Applications: Advertisement
::: columns
:::: {.column width=50%}
- **Mobile advertisement**
  - Mobile phones are ubiquitous
  - 80% of world population has one
  - 6.5 billion smartphones
- **Integrate online and offline databases**, e.g.,
  - GPS location
  - Search history
  - Credit card transactions

:::
- E.g.,
  - You've bought a new house
  - You google questions about house renovations
  - You watch shows about renovations
  - Your phone tracks where you are
  - Google sends you coupons for the closest Home Depot
  - _"I feel like Google is following me"_

* Big Data Applications: Medicine
- **Personalized medicine**
  - Patients receive treatment tailored to them for efficacy
  - Genetics
  - Daily activities
  - Environment
  - Habits
- **Biomedical data**
- **Genome sequencing**
- **Health tech**
  - Personal health trackers (e.g., smart rings, phones)

* Big Data Applications: Smart Cities
- **Smart cities**
  - Interconnected mesh of sensors
  - E.g., traffic sensors, camera networks, satellites
- **Goals**
  - Monitor air pollution
  - Minimize traffic congestion
  - Optimal urban services
  - Maximize energy savings

* Goal of Data Science
::: columns
:::: {.column width=50%}
- **Goal**: from data to wisdom
  - Data (raw bytes)
  - Information (organized, structured)
  - Knowledge (learning)
  - Wisdom (understanding)
- **Insights enable decisions and actions**
- Combine streams of big data to **generate new data**
  - New data can be "big data" itself
