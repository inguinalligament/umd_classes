* SQL Overview

- **Relational algebra**: mathematical language to manipulate _relations_

- **SQL**: language to describe and transform data in a relational DB
  - Originally Sequel
  - Changed to Structured Query Language

- **SQL statements grouped by goal**
  - Data definition language (DDL)
    - Define schema (tables, attributes, indices)
    - Specify integrity constraints (primary key, foreign key, not null)
  - Data modification language (DML)
    - Modify data in tables
    - Insert, Update, Delete
  - Query data (DQL)
  - Control transactions
    - Specify beginning and end, control isolation level
  - Define views
  - Authorization
    - Specify access and security constraints

* SQL Overview

- Data description language (DDL)

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE <name> (<field> <domain>, ... )
  ```

- Data modification language (DML)

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO <name> (<field names>) VALUES (<field values>)
  DELETE FROM <name> WHERE <condition>
  UPDATE <name> SET <field name> = <value> WHERE <condition>
  ```

- Query language

  ```sql
  SELECT <fields> FROM <name> WHERE <condition>
  ```

* Create Table
:::columns
::::{.column width=50%}
```sql
  CREATE TABLE r
   (A_1 D_1,
   A_2 D_2,
   ...,
   A_n D_n,
   IntegrityConstraint_1,
   IntegrityConstraint_n);
```
::::
::::{.column width=50%}
where:

- `r` is name of _table_ (aka _relation_)
- `A_i` name of _attribute_ (aka _field_, _column_)
- `D_i` domain of attribute `A_i`
::::
:::
- **Constraints**
  - SQL prevents changes violating integrity constraints
  - Primary key
    - Must be non-null and unique
    - `PRIMARY KEY (A_j1, A_j2, ..., A_jn)`
  - Foreign key
    - Attribute values must match primary key values in relation s
    - `FOREIGN KEY (A_k1, A_k2, ..., A_kn) REFERENCES s`
  - Not null
    - Null value not allowed for attribute
    - A_i D_i NOT NULL

* Select

```sql
SELECT A_1, A_2, ..., A_n
    FROM r_1, r_2, ..., r_m
    WHERE P;
```

- `SELECT`: select the attributes to list (i.e., projection)
- `FROM`: list of tables to be accessed
  - Define a Cartesian product of the tables
  - The query is going to be optimized to avoid to enumerate tuples that will be
    eliminated
- `WHERE`: predicate involving attributes of the relations in the `FROM` clause
  (i.e., selection)
- In `SELECT` or `WHERE` clauses, might need to use the table names as prefix to
  qualify the attribute name
  - E.g., `instructor.ID` vs `teaches.ID`
- A `SELECT` statement can be expressed in terms of relational algebra
  - Cartesian product $\to$ selection $\to$ projection
  - Difference: SQL allows duplicate values, relational algebra works with
    mathematical sets

* Null Values
- An arithmetic operation with `NULL` yields `NULL`
- Comparison with NULL
  - `1 < NULL`
  - `NOT(1 < NULL)`
  - SQL yields `UNKNOWN` when comparing with `NULL` value
  - There are 3 logical values: `True`, `False`, `Unknown`
- Boolean operators
  - Can be extended according to common sense, e.g.,
  - `True AND UNKNOWN = UNKNOWN`
  - `False AND Unknown = False`
- In a `WHERE` clause, if the result is `UNKNOWN` it's not included

* Group by Query
::: columns
:::: {.column width=65%}
- The attributes in `GROUP BY` are used to form groups
  - Tuples with the same value on all attributes are placed in one group
- Any attribute that is not in the `GROUP BY` can appear in the `SELECT` clause
  only as argument of aggregate function

\vspace{0.25cm}

```sql
    SELECT dept_name, AVG(salary)
        FROM instructor
        GROUP BY dept_name;
```

\vspace{0.25cm}
```
    -- Error.
```

```sql
    SELECT dept_name, salary
        FROM instructor
        GROUP BY dept_name;
```

\vspace{0.25cm}

- `salary` is not in `GROUP BY` so it must be in an aggregate function
::::
:::: {.column width=35%}

![](data605/lectures_source/images/lecture_4_1/lec_4_1_slide_20_image_2.png)
::::
:::

* Having
- State a condition that applies to groups instead of tuples (like WHERE)
- Any attribute in the HAVING clause must appear in the GROUP BY clause
- E.g., find departments with avg salary of instructors > 42k
  ```sql
      SELECT dept_name, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
          FROM instructor
          GROUP BY dept_name
          HAVING AVG(salary) > 42000;
  ```

\vspace{0.5cm}

- How does it work
  - `FROM` is evaluated to create a relation
  - (optional) `WHERE` is used to filter
  - `GROUP BY` collects tuples into groups
  - (optional) `HAVING` is applied to each group and groups are filtered
  - `SELECT` generates tuples of the results, applying aggregate functions to get
    a single result for each group

* Nested Subqueries
- SQL allows using the result of a query in another query
  - Use a subquery returning one attribute (scalar subquery) where a value is
    used
  - Use the result of a query for set membership in the WHERE clause
  - Use the result of a query in a FROM clause
:::columns
::::{.column width=60%}  
```sql
SELECT tmp.dept_name, tmp.avg_salary
  FROM (
    SELECT dept_name,
        AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM instructor
    GROUP BY dept_name) AS tmp
WHERE avg_salary > 42000
```
::::
::::{.column width=40%}  
![](data605/lectures_source/images/lecture_4_1/lec_4_1_slide_22_image_1.png)
::::
:::

* With
- `WITH` clause allows to define a temporary relation containing the results of
  a subquery
- It can be equivalent to a nested subqueries, but clearer

- E.g., find department with the maximum budget
  :::columns
  ::::{.column width=80%}  
```sql
WITH max_budget(value) as (
  SELECT MAX(budget) FROM department)
  SELECT department.dept_name, budget
    FROM department, max_budget
    WHERE department.budget = max_budget.value
```
::::
::::{.column width=20%}  
![](data605/lectures_source/images/lecture_4_1/lec_4_1_slide_23_image_1.png)
::::
:::

* Insert
- To insert data into a relation we can specify tuples to insert
  - Tuples
  \begingroup
  \footnotesize
  ```sql
      INSERT INTO course VALUES ('DATA-605', 'Big data systems', 'Comp. Sci.', 3)
      INSERT INTO course(course_id, title, dept_name, credits)
          VALUES ('DATA-605', 'Big data systems', 'Comp. Sci.', 3)
  ```

  \endgroup
  - Query whose results is a set of tuples
  ```sql
      INSERT INTO instructor
          (SELECT ID, name, dept_name, 18000
          FROM student
          WHERE dept_name = 'Music' AND tot_cred > 144)
  ```
  - Nested queries are evaluated and then inserted so this doesn't create
    infinite loops
    ```sql
      INSERT INTO student (SELECT * FROM student)
    ```
  - Many DB have bulk loader utilities to insert a large set of tuples into a
    relation, reading from formatted text files This is much faster than INSERT
    statements

* Update
- SQL can change a value in a tuple without changing all the other values
- E.g., increase salary of all instructors by 5%
  ```sql
  UPDATE instructor SET salary = salary * 1.05
  ```
- E.g., conditionally
  ```sql
  UPDATE instructor SET salary = salary * 1.05
      WHERE salary < 70000
  ```
- Nesting is allowed

  ```sql
  UPDATE instructor SET salary = salary * 1.05
      WHERE salary < (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM instructor)
  ```

* Delete
- One can delete tuples using a query returning entire rows of a table
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM r WHERE p
  ```
  where:
  - r is a relation
  - P is a predicate
- Remove all tuples (but not the table)

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM instructor
  ```

## #############################################################################
## Movie Database Example (Optional)
## #############################################################################

* Example Schema for SQL Queries
\footnotesize

```schema
Movie(title, year, length, inColor, studioName, producerC\#)
StarsIn(movieTitle, movieYear, starName)
MovieStar(name, address, gender, birthdate)
MovieExec(name, address, cert\#, netWorth)
Studio(name, address, presC\#)
```

![](data605/lectures_source/images/lecture_4_1/lec_4_1_slide_29_image_1.png){width=70%}

* SQL: Data Definition
- CREATE TABLE

```sql
    CREATE TABLE movieExec (
        name char(30),
        address char(100),
        cert# integer primary key,
        networth integer);

    CREATE TABLE movie (
        title char(100),
        year integer,
        length integer,
        inColor smallint,
        studioName char(20),
        producerC# integer references
            movieExec(cert#) );
```

- Must define movieExec before movie. Why?

* SQL: Data Manipulation
- INSERT
  ```sql
      INSERT INTO StarsIn values('King Kong', 2005, 'Naomi Watts');
  ```
  ```sql
      INSERT INTO StarsIn(starName, movieTitle, movieYear)
          values('Naomi Watts', 'King Kong', 2005);
  ```
- DELETE

  ```sql
      DELETE FROM movies WHERE movieYear < 1980;
  ```
  - Syntax is fine, but this command will be rejected. Why?

  ```sql
      DELETE FROM movies
          WHERE length < (SELECT avg(length) FROM movies);
  ```
  - Problem: as we delete tuples, the average length changes
  - Solution:
    - First, compute avg length and find all tuples to delete
    - Next, delete all tuples found above (without recomputing avg or retesting
      the tuples)

* SQL: Data Manipulation
- UPDATE
  - Increase all movieExec netWorth's over 100,000 USD by 6%, all other accounts
    receive 5%
  - Write two update statements:

  ```sql
      UPDATE movieExec SET netWorth = netWorth * 1.06
          WHERE netWorth > 100000;
  ```

  ```sql
      UPDATE movieExec SET netWorth = netWorth * 1.05
          WHERE netWorth <= 100000;
  ```
  - The order is important
  - Can be done better using the case statement

  ```sql
      UPDATE movieExec SET netWorth =
          CASE
              WHEN netWorth > 100000 THEN netWorth * 1.06
              WHEN netWorth <= 100000 THEN netWorth * 1.05
          END;
  ```

* SQL Single Table Queries
- Movies produced by Disney in 1990: note the _rename_

  ```sql
      SELECT m.title, m.year
          FROM movie m
          WHERE m.studioname = 'disney' AND m.year = 1990;
  ```
  - The SELECT clause can contain expressions

  ```sql
      SELECT title || ' (' || to_char(year) || ')' AS titleyear
  ```

  ```sql
      SELECT 2014 - year
  ```
  - The WHERE clause support a large number of different predicates and
    combinations thereof

  ```sql
      year BETWEEN 1990 and 1995
  ```

  ```sql
      title LIKE 'star wars%'
  ```

  ```sql
      title LIKE 'star wars _'
  ```

* Single Table Queries
- Find distinct movies sorted by title
  ```sql
      SELECT DISTINCT title
          FROM movie
          WHERE studioname = 'disney' AND year = 1990
          ORDER by title;
  ```
- Average length of a movie
  ```sql
      SELECT year, avg(length)
          FROM movie
          GROUP BY year;
  ```
- **GROUP BY:** is a very important concept that shows up in many data
  processing platforms
  - What it does:
    - Partition the tuples by the group attributes (_year_ in this case)
    - Do something (_compute avg_ in this case) for each group
    - Number of resulting tuples == number of groups

* Single Table Queries
- Find movie with the maximum length
  ```sql
      SELECT title, year
          FROM movie
          WHERE movie.length = (SELECT max(length) FROM movie);
  ```
  - The smaller "subquery" is called a "nested subquery"
- Find movies with at most 5 stars: an example of a correlated subquery

  ```sql
      SELECT *
          FROM movies m
          WHERE 5 >= (SELECT count(*)
                      FROM starsIn si
                      WHERE si.title = m.title AND
                            si.year = m.year);
  ```
  - The "inner" subquery counts the number of actors for that movie.

* Single Table Queries
- Rank movies by their length
  ```sql
      SELECT title, year,
          (SELECT count(*)
          FROM movies m2
          WHERE m1.length <= m2.length) AS rank
          FROM movies m1;
  ```
  - Key insight: A movie is ranked 5th if there are exactly 4 movies with longer
    length.
  - Most database systems support some sort of a _rank_ keyword for doing this
  - The above query doesn't work in presence of ties, etc.
- Set operations

  ```sql
      SELECT name
          FROM movieExec
      union/intersect/minus
          SELECT name FROM
              movieStar
  ```

* Single Table Queries
- Set Comparisons

  ```sql
  SELECT *
      FROM movies
      WHERE year IN [1990, 1995, 2000];
  ```

  ```sql
  SELECT *
      FROM movies
      WHERE year NOT IN (
          SELECT EXTRACT(year from birthdate)
          FROM MovieStar
      );
  ```

* Multi-Table Queries
- Key:
  - Do a join to get an appropriate table
  - Use the constructs for single-table queries
  - You will get used to doing all at once
- Examples:

  ```sql
      SELECT title, year, me.name AS producerName
          FROM movies m, movieexec me
          WHERE m.producerC# = me.cert#;
  ```

* Multi-Table Queries
- Consider the query:

  ```sql
      SELECT title, year, producerC#, count(starName)
          FROM movies, starsIn
          WHERE title = starsIn.movieTitle AND
                year = starsIn.movieYear
          GROUP BY title, year, producerC#
  ```
  - What about movies with no stars?
  - Need to use **outer joins**

  ```sql
      SELECT title, year, producerC#, count(starName)
          FROM movies LEFT OUTER JOIN starsIn
          ON title = starsIn.movieTitle AND year = starsIn.movieYear
          GROUP BY title, year, producerC#
  ```
  - All tuples from 'movies' that have no matches in starsIn are included with
    NULLs
  - So if a tuple (m1, 1990) has no match in starsIn, we get (m1, 1990, NULL) in
    the result
  - The count(starName) works correctly then
  - Note: count(\*) would not work correctly (NULLs can have unintuitive
    behavior)

* Other SQL Constructs
- Views

  ```sql
    CREATE VIEW DisneyMovies
        SELECT *
            FROM movie m
            WHERE m.studioname = 'disney';
  ```
  - Can use it in any place where a table name is used
  - Views are used quite extensively to:
    - Simplify queries
    - Hide data (by giving users access only to specific views)
  - Views may be *materialized *or not

* Other SQL Constructs
- NULLs
  - Value of any attribute can be NULL
  - Because: value is unknown, or it is not applicable, or hidden, etc.
  - Can lead to counterintuitive behavior
  - For example, the following query does not return movies where length = NULL
  ```sql
        SELECT * FROM movies
        WHERE length >= 120 OR length <= 120
  ```
  - Aggregate operations can be especially tricky
- Transactions
  - A transaction is a sequence of queries and update statements executed as a
    single unit
  - For example, transferring money from one account to another
    - Both the _deduction_ from one account and _credit_ to the other account
      should happen, or neither should
- Triggers
  - A trigger is a statement that is executed automatically by the system as a
    side effect of a modification to the database

* Other SQL Constructs
- Integrity Constraints
  - Predicates on the database that must always hold
  - Key Constraints: Specifying something is a primary key or unique

  ```sql
      CREATE TABLE customer (
          ssn CHAR(9) PRIMARY KEY,
          cname CHAR(15),
          address CHAR(30),
          city CHAR(10),
      UNIQUE (cname, address, city));
  ```
  - Attribute constraints: Constraints on the values of attributes

  ```sql
  bname char(15) not null
  ```

  ```sql
  balance int not null, check (balance>= 0)
  ```

* Integrity Constraints
- Referential integrity: prevent dangling tuples
  ```sql
    CREATE TABLE branch(bname CHAR(15) PRIMARY KEY, ...);
    CREATE TABLE loan(..., FOREIGN KEY bname REFERENCES branch);
  ```
- Can tell the system what to do if a referenced tuple is being deleted

* Integrity Constraints
- Global Constraints
  - Single-table
    ```sql
      CREATE TABLE branch (..., bcity CHAR(15), assets INT,
          CHECK (NOT(bcity = 'Bkln') OR assets>5M))
    ```
  - Multi-table
    ```sql
      CREATE ASSERTION loan-constraint
      CHECK (NOT EXISTS
          (SELECT* FROM loan AS L WHERE NOT EXISTS
              (SELECT* FROM borrower B, depositor D, account A
              WHERE B.cname = D.cname AND D.acct_no = A.acct_no
                  AND L.lno= B.lno)))
    ```

* Additional SQL Constructs
- `SELECT` subquery factoring
  - To allow assigning a name to a subquery, then use its result by referencing
    that name
    ```sql
      WITH temp AS (
          SELECT title, avg(length)
          FROM movies
          GROUP BY year)
      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM temp;
    ```
  - Can have multiple subqueries (multiple with clauses)
  - Real advantage is when subquery needs to be referenced multiple times in
    main select
  - Helps with complex queries, both for readability and maybe performance (can
    cache subquery results)

* Another SQL Construct
- `SELECT HAVING` clause
  - Used in combination with `GROUP BY` to restrict the groups of returned rows
    to only those where condition evaluates to true
  ```sql
    SELECT year, count(*)
        FROM movies
        WHERE year > 1980
        GROUP BY year
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
  ```
  - Difference from `WHERE` clause is that it applies to summarized group
    records, and where applies to individual records
