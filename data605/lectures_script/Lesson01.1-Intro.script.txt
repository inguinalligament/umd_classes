# Invariants of a Class Lecture
# ##############################################################################

- Invariants in programming are key concepts that remain constant during a
  program's execution
  - This class also has invariants related to our material coverage
- We'll use interactive Jupyter notebook tutorials for learning. These can be
  completed at home, allowing self-paced learning. Jupyter notebooks let you
  experiment with code and observe invariants in action
- We'll alternate between slides, whiteboard discussions, and hands-on
  tutorials. This diverse approach supports various learning styles and
  reinforces covered concepts
- Labs are crucial for this course. They offer a chance to review complete class
  project examples, providing a thorough understanding of invariants in
  practice. Collaboration is encouraged in labs, fostering teamwork skills and
  peer learning

# ##############################################################################
# Books of the Class
# ##############################################################################

- Because AI and machine learning are improving so quickly there is not a single
  book that we can use in this class to cover the material
- The slides used in this class are derived from a variety of sources including
  books, technical articles, and the Internet
  - This means that they are designed to be comprehensive and provide all the
    necessary information you need to understand the topics being discussed
- The goal is for the slides to be self-sufficient, meaning you should be able to
  grasp the key concepts and ideas without needing to refer back to the original
  sources

Let's move on to the learning outcomes you can expect from this course.
