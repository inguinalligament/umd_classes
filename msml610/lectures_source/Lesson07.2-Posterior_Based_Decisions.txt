# Posterior-Based Decisions

* Posterior-Based Decisions
- Sometimes describing the posterior is not enough
  - **Make decisions based on inference**

- E.g., is the coin fair ($\theta = 0.5$) or biased?
  - $\EE[\hat{\theta}] = 0.324$ suggests bias
  - Can't rule out unbiased since:
    - $HPI = [0.03, 0.65]$
    - $0.5 \in HPI$
  - For **sharper decisions**:
    - Collect more data to reduce posterior spread
    - Define a more informative prior

* Savage-Dickey Density Ratio
- **Savage-Dickey ratio** tests _point null-hypotheses_ in Bayesian inference

- **Idea**: compare prior and posterior densities at a single point $\theta_0$
  \begingroup \scriptsize
  $$
  BF_{01} = \frac{p(\theta_0 | H_1)}{p(\theta_0 | \mathcal{D}, H_1)}
  $$
  \endgroup where:
  - $p(\theta_0 | H_1)$ is _prior_ density $\theta$ under alternative hypothesis
    $H_1$, evaluated at $\theta_0$
  - $p(\theta_0 | \mathcal{D}, H_1)$ is _posterior_ density $\theta$ under $H_1$
    evaluated at $\theta_0$

::: columns
:::: {.column width=50%}
- **Intuition**: show how data changes belief about $\theta_0$
  - If posterior density at $\theta_0$ is much smaller than prior density,
    strong evidence against null hypothesis $H_0$
- **Cons**:
  - It's a point statistics (not considering the entire posterior)

::: columns

![](msml610/lectures_source/figures/Lesson07_Savage_Dickey.png)

::::
:::: {.column width=45%}
- $H_0$: "coin is fair"
  - The prior is 0.87
  - The posterior is 1.15
  - $BF_{10} = 0.76$ $\to$ **no evidence** to reject the null hypothesis

- In the other case
  - $BF_{10} = 15.06$ $\to$ **strong evidence** to reject the null hypothesis
::::

* Region of Practical Equivalence
- **Region of Practical Equivalence** (ROPE) = interval where values are
  "equivalent"

- **Example**
  - $H_0$: _"coin is fair"_ impractical if $\theta = 0.5$
  - ROPE: $\theta \in [0.45, 0.55]$ equivalent to $0.5$

- **Hypothesis testing with ROPE and HPI**
  - Compare ROPE with HPI (Highest-Posterior Interval)
    - HPI within ROPE $\to$ no effect, reject $H_1$
    - HPI outside ROPE $\to$ effect present, reject $H_0$
    - HPI overlaps ROPE $\to$ inconclusive

- **Decide ROPE before analysis based on domain knowledge**
  - Picking it after analysis is like choosing p-value threshold after seeing
    p-value

* Loss Function: Motivation

- For many problems:
  - **Make decisions based on inference**
  - **Decision cost is asymmetric**
    - Cost of a bad decision > or < benefit of a good decision
    - Vaccines may cause overreaction, but benefits outweigh risks

- Measure for **best decision**:
  - Benefits of a correct decision
  - Cost of a mistake
  - Trade-off between benefits and costs using a loss function
  - Use loss function for decisions

* Loss Function
- Aka "cost function"
  - The inverse is known as "objective", "fitness", "utility function"

- **Loss function** quantifies _"how bad is an estimation mistake?"_
  - Larger loss indicates worse estimation
  - Loss is difference between:
    - The true value $\theta$; and
    - The estimated value $\hat{\theta}$

\begingroup \scriptsize
| **Loss**       | **Expression**               | **Point estimate**    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- | 
| Quadratic loss | $(\theta - \hat{\theta})^2$  | Mean of posterior     |
| Absolute loss  | $|\theta - \hat{\theta}|$    | Median of posterior   |
| 1-0 loss       | $I(\theta \ne \hat{\theta})$ | Mode of posterior     |
\endgroup

- Algorithm to make decisions in Bayesian statistics using loss function
  - Goal: pick a single value $\hat{\theta}$
  - True value $\theta$ is unknown
  - Estimate $\theta$ using posterior distribution
  - Find $\hat{\theta}$ minimizing expected loss function

## Chemical Shift: Example

* Chemical Shift

- **Nuclear magnetic resonance** (NMR)
  - Used to study molecules of living things
  - Measures observable quantities related to unobservable molecular properties
    (e.g., chemical shift)

- **Chemical shift** reveals local magnetic environment of atomic nuclei
  - Identifies molecular structure and functional groups

* Use of Gaussians in Statistics
- Aka "normal" distribution

- **Gaussians** are:
  - easy to work with
  - abundant in nature

- **Pros**:
  - Average of large sample size tends to be Gaussian (Central Limit Theorem)
  - Many phenomena approximated using Gaussians (since they are average of
    effects)
  - Conjugate prior of Gaussian is Gaussian

- **Cons**:
  - Not robust to outliers
  - Important to relax assumption of Gaussianity

* Chemical Shift: Example

- **Assume Gaussian** approximates data from example chemical shift

- **Likelihood** from normal distribution:

  - **Mean** from uniform distribution

    - Larger than data range, e.g., $[40, 70]$
  - **Std dev** from half-normal distribution

## Posterior Predictive Checks

* Samples from Posterior Distribution
- Given **\blue{posterior distribution $\Pr(\theta | y)$}**, generate predictions
  **\red{$\tilde{y}$}** based on data **\green{$y$}** and estimated parameters
  **\purple{$\hat{\theta}$}**:
  $$
  \Pr(\red{\tilde{y}} | \green{y})
  = \int_{\purple{\hat{\theta}}} \Pr(\tilde{y} | \theta)
    \blue{\Pr(\theta | y)} d\theta
  = \int \text{model} \times \text{posterior}
  $$
  - This is called the _"posterior predictive distribution"_ as it
    predicts _future data_ using the _posterior distribution_

- **\black{Conceptually}**
  - Sample a value of $\theta$ from the posterior $\Pr(\theta | y)$
  - Feed the value of $\theta$ to the likelihood $\Pr(\tilde{y} | \theta)$
  - Obtain $\tilde{y}$

- This process has **\black{two sources of uncertainty}**:
  - Parameter uncertainty
    - Captured by the posterior $\Pr(\theta | y)$
  - Sampling uncertainty
    - Captured by the likelihood $\Pr(\tilde{y} | \theta)$

* Posterior Predictive Check (PPC)

- **PPC approach**:
  - Generate predictions $\tilde{y}$ with observed data $y$ from posterior
    distribution
  - Check consistency between predictions and observed data

- **Intuition**: can the model reproduce observed data?
  - Always check!

- **Differences** arise from:
  - Mistakes
  - Model limitations
    - E.g., works for average behavior but fails for rare values
  - Data limitations

* Bayesian Workflow Using PPC

1. Given a process, **true distribution** is unknown / unknowable

2. **Sample the process**
   - Get finite sample $y$
   - E.g., experiment, survey, simulation

3. **Inference**
   - Build probabilistic model using prior $\Pr(\theta)$ and likelihood
     $\Pr(y | \theta)$ to get posterior $\Pr(\theta | y)$
   - Posterior is distribution of model parameters $\theta$ given data

4. **Predictive distribution**
   - Compute predictions from posterior (posterior predictive distribution)
   - Posterior predictive is distribution of predicted samples averaged over
     posterior

5. **Validation**
   - Validate model by comparing original vs predicted samples

* Chemical Shift: Model Critique
::: columns
:::: {.column width=50%}
- **Problem**
  - Two data points on distribution tails

:::

- **Possible solutions**
  1) Declare and discard outliers
     - E.g., equipment malfunction (requires evidence)
  2) Change the model
  3) **Bayesian philosophy**
     - Encode assumptions into the model (e.g., priors, likelihoods)
     - Avoid ad-hoc heuristics (e.g., outlier removal rules)

* Student's t-distribution: Recap
- **Student's t-distribution** has 3 params:
  1. Mean $\mu$
     - Doesn't always exist
  2. Scale $\sigma$
     - Similar to std dev, but doesn't always exist
3. Degrees of freedom $\nu \in [0, \infty]$
   - "Normality parameter": controls distribution normality
   - $\nu=1$: heavy tails, no mean (Cauchy)
   - $\nu \to \infty$: Gaussian

- Student's t has **heavy tails** (high kurtosis)
  - Values more likely far from mean compared to Normal

## Groups Comparison

* Group Comparison

- **Group comparison** tests for statistically significant results between
  _treatment_ and _control group_

- E.g.,
  - _How well do patients respond to a new drug vs a placebo?_
  - _Is there a reduction in car accidents after new traffic regulation?_
  - _Does college student performance improve without cellphones at school?_

- **Effect size** quantifies the difference between two groups
  - From _"does it work?"_ (hypothesis testing) to _"how well does it work?"_
    (estimate effect size)

* Bogus Control Groups
- **Always ask for the baseline** used for comparison, when something is claimed
  to be harder/better/faster/stronger
  - E.g., sell sugary yogurts to boost the immune system by comparing it to milk
    - Better control group: less sugary yogurt

- **Placebo** is a psychological phenomenon where a patient experiences
  improvements after receiving an inactive treatment
  - Using a placebo is better than "no treatment"
  - Shows difficulty in accounting for all factors in an experiment

* Group Comparison Bayesian-Style
- **Frequentist approach**
  - Compare p-value of difference of means in each group

- **Bayesian approach**
  - Compare posterior distribution of means between groups using:
    - Plot of posterior
    - Cohen's d
    - Probability of superiority

* Sample Size Effect
::: columns
:::: {.column width=60%}
- **Sample size effect** is the impact of the number of observations on
  statistical results (e.g., p-values, confidence intervals)

- **Small sample effect**
  - Large mean difference might not be statistically significant (low p-value)
  - Estimates (e.g., means, proportions, correlations) fluctuate widely due to
    high sampling variability
  - Outliers have a disproportionate influence
  - Inference is unstable: results may not replicate

- **Large sample**:
  - Tiny mean difference can be highly significant (small p-value) but
    meaningless

- E.g., Cohen's d, probability of superiority

::::
:::

* Cohen's d
- **Cohen's d** is the difference of means relative to pooled standard deviation
  $$
  \frac{\mu_2 - \mu_1}{\sqrt{(\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2) / 2}}
  $$
  - Normalizes effect by variability for pooled std dev
  - Variability of each group normalizes mean difference
  - Similar to a Z-score, number of std dev values differ
    ![](msml610/lectures_source/figures/Lesson07_Cohen_d.png)

- **Bayesian approach**
  - Compute posterior distribution of means and std $\to$ formula
  - Compute distribution of Cohen's d $\to$ summary statistics

//* Probability of Superiority
//- = probability that a data point taken randomly from one group is larger than a
//  random point from the other group
