## Why Causal AI?
## #############################################################################

* Big Data and Traditional AI
- For the past 10 years, **focus of analytics** on:
  - Organize and analyze massive amount of data
  - Data analytics (dashboards, models, reports)
  - Run machine learning on data

- Problems with **traditional AI**
  - Predicts based on observed correlations
  - Can't explain why an outcome occurred

- **AI in decision making**
  - Understand impact of decisions
  - E.g., _"What happens if a product price is reduced by 10%?"_
    - Will more customers buy?
    - If revenue decreases, what to do?
    - Why are customers leaving? Quality issue? Emerging competitor?

* What Are Data Analytics?
- **Collections of data**
  - Aggregated, organized data sets for analysis
  - E.g., customer purchase histories in a CRM system

- **Descriptive statistics**
  - Summary metrics: mean, median, mode, standard deviation
  - E.g., average sales per quarter to understand trends

- **Historical reports**
  - Examination of _past performance_
  - E.g., monthly sales reports for past fiscal year

- **Dashboards**
  - Visual displays of key metrics for insights
  - E.g., dashboard showing quarterly revenue, expenses

- **Models**
  - Statistical representations to _forecast, explain phenomena_
  - E.g., model to anticipate customer churn based on behavioral data

* AI / ML Explainability
- **Regulators** require you to defend ML/AI decision results
  - E.g., hiring decisions, policy setup

- E.g., neural networks are "black boxes"
  - Lack of explainability
    - Humans can't understand input-to-conclusion process (easily or at all)
    - Can't explain decisions to shareholders
  - Bias
    - E.g., using age, race, sex as features can introduce bias

- Drawbacks: organizations can:
  - **Be fined** by authorities
  - **Face backlash** from customers and activists

- Solution:
  - **Explainable AI** allows users to:
    - Comprehend
    - Explain
    - Trust machine results

* Correlation is Not Causation!
- **Correlation** is a statistical method for understanding relationships
  between data
  - Pros
    - Use past outcomes to predict future outcomes by finding patterns and
      anomalies
  - Cons
    - Doesn't explain the cause
    - Variables may move together due to coincidence or a hidden factor

- **Causation** explains how changing one variable influences the other
  - Cannot be concluded from correlation alone

- **Data does not understand causes and effects**
  - Only humans can identify variables and relationships based on context
  - Without causation, you can't make intelligent decisions

* Causal AI
- **Understands the why**
  - Determines cause-and-effect between variables
  - E.g., whether a marketing campaign increased sales

- **Identify interventions**
  - Identifies variables and interventions to change outcomes
  - E.g., which lifestyle changes reduce blood pressure

- **Predicting counterfactuals**
  - Hypothesizes outcomes under different circumstances
  - E.g., student grades if they attended a different school

- **Avoiding bias**
  - Traditional AI biased by training data and ignored variables
  - Ensure fairness by accounting for confounding variables

- **Improving decision-making**
  - Provides understanding of relationships for better decisions
  - E.g., improve supply chain by understanding impact of decisions on logistics

* Causal AI vs Traditional AI
- **Current AI** uses correlation to:
  - Analyze data
  - Identify patterns
  - Make predictions

- **Models depend on data quality**
  - Biased or unclean data $\implies$ poor model

- _"The next revolution of data science is the science of interpreting reality,
  not of summarizing data"_ (Judea Pearl, 2021)

## The Ladder of Causation

* The Ladder of Causation

- Pearl provided a 3-level framework for understanding causality
  1) Association
  2) Intervention
  3) Counterfactuals

\begingroup \scriptsize
| **Level**          | **Symbol**         | **Activity** | **Typical Questions** |
| ------------------ | -------------------| -------------| ----------------------|
| 1. Association     | $\Pr(Y | X)$       | Observing    | What is?              |
| 2. Intervention    | $\Pr(Y | do(X), Z)$| Intervening  | What if?              |
| 3. Counterfactuals | $\Pr(Y_X | x', y')$| Imagining    | Why?                  |
\endgroup

* Rung 1: Association
- **Question**: _"How would seeing $X$ change our belief in $Y$?"_

- **In math terms**: $\Pr(Y|X)$

- **Activity**
  - It is just "passive observation" to determine if $X, Y$ are related
  - Traditional AI and ML is based on this
  - In the best case, it's Bayesian update
  - In the worst case, it's some hacked up overfitted model

- **Example**
  - _"The tree has green leaves during spring"_
  - _"What does a symptom tell you about a disease?"_
  - _"What does a survey tell you about the election results?"_

* Rung 2: Intervention
- **Question**: _"What happens to $Y$ if you do $X$?"_

- **In math terms**: $\Pr(Y | do(X), Z)$

- **Activity**
  - Understand the impact of an action $X$ on $Y$ under conditions $Z$
  - Association is just about observations
  - Interventions involve "doing something" and need a causal model

- **Example**
  - _"Spring makes tree leaves turn green"_ (vs _"tree has green leaves"_)
  - _"Why did the headache go away?"_
    - "Because the pain reliever" or "Because you ate food after skipping lunch"
  - _"If you take aspirin, will your headache be cured?"_
  - _"What if you ban sodas?"_

* Rung 3: Counterfactuals
- **Question**: _"Was $X$ that caused $Y$?"_

- **Symbol**: $\Pr(Y_X | x', y')$

- **Activity**:
  - Imagine what will happen if facts were different
  - Predicting an outcome is the highest form of reasoning
    - It requires to understand relationships between cause and effect

- **Example**
  - Scientific experiments: _"What if we give a child an adult dose of a drug?"_
  - Litigation: _"What would the jury conclude?"_
  - Marketing: _"Why did my marketing campaign fail to generate sales?"_

## Correlation vs Causation Models
## #############################################################################

* Correlation vs Causation Model
- **Correlation** = identify how variables are related to each other
- **Causality** = determine whether one variable causes another variable

  - Both:
    - Accept inputs and transform them to compute predictions
    - Identify how variables are related to each other

  - Correlation-based AI works well when there is abundant historical and
    observational data
  - Causal-based AI first creates a business-focused model before integrating data

* Correlation-Based Model Process
- **Correlation-based AI is "data first"**
  - The more data collected the better

- **Modeling process**
  - Acquire data
  - Integrate and clean data
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Feature engineering
  - Build and test models
  - Deploy models in production

- **Many AI projects fail because**
  - Cultural and organizational issues
  - Models are opaque and lack explainability
  - Spurious correlations
  - Missing articulating _"what's the goal of doing ML?"_

* Causation-based Model Process
- **Causal AI is "model first"**
  - Understand business question before ingest and transform the data

- **Modeling process**
  - What is the intended outcome?
  - What is the proposed intervention?
  - What are the confounding factors?
  - What are the effecting factors?
  - Create a model graph or diagram
  - Data acquisition
  - ...
