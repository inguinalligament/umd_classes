# Logic-Based AI Under Uncertainty
# ##############################################################################

* Logic-Based AI Under Uncertainty: Problem

- **Logic-based AI systems**:
  - Based on **propositional logic**
  - Represent **actions** using **rules** like:
    - _"If preconditions P hold, then action A causes effect E"_
  - Example:
    - _"If I turn the car key, the engine starts"_
    - **But**: the battery might be dead, there's no fuel, the starter is
      broken, etc.

- Real-world agents face **uncertainty** from:
  - Partial observability
    - Agent can't see the full state of the world
  - Non-determinism
    - Actions don't always have predictable outcomes
  - Adversarial conditions
    - Other agents may interfere

* Logic-Based AI Under Uncertainty: Naive Solution

- A possible solution to uncertainty is:

  1. Use a **belief state**, i.e., set of all possible current world states
  2. Use **causal and exhaustive augmentation** for rules
     - Must consider all possible preconditions for acting, even unlikely ones
  3. Construct **contingent plans** that handle every possible sensor report and
     belief
     - Plans become large and complex
     - No guaranteed plan may exist, yet action is required

* Logic-Based AI Under Uncertainty: Example
- **Goal**: start a car by turning the car key

- **Obvious preconditions**
  - The car has fuel
  - The car battery is charged
  - The car key is the right one
  - The starter motor is working
  - ...

- **Less obvious preconditions**
  - The fuel lines are not clogged
  - The fuel pump is working
  - The electrical system is intact (no blown fuses)
  - The engine oil level is sufficient
  - ...

- Every precondition requires something different to do to achieve the goal!

* Causal and Exhaustive Augmentation
- To use propositional logic under uncertainty, augment the left-side of
  $X \implies Y$ to make it:
  1. **Causal**: identify true causal-effect relationships
  2. **Exhaustive**: identify all possible conditions leading to the outcome

- **Logical qualification problem**
  - Enumerate all the preconditions necessary for an action to succeed

- **Difficulties**
  - Every action can have more hidden conditions in order to succeed
    - E.g., start the engine $\implies$ turn car key $\implies$ starter motor is
      working $\implies$ battery is charged $\implies$ ...
  - Preconditions can change depending on the situation
    - E.g., start the engine $\implies$ battery is charged $\implies$ it's not
      too cold $\implies$ ...

* Causal and Exhaustive Augmentation
- **Limitations** of logical qualification
  1. **Laziness**
     - Too much work to create all possible rules
  2. **Theoretical ignorance**
     - Science doesn't always have a complete theory of the domain
     - E.g., medical science doesn't know all the "rules"
  3. **Practical ignorance**
     - Even if you knew all the rules, you might not have all the information
       needed
     - E.g., not all necessary medical tests can be run for a particular patient

- Expert systems failure and AI winter (mid 1980s, 1990s)
  - The real world is complex and open-ended
  - Logical rules can't capture all necessary and sufficient conditions

* Failure of Logic-Based AI: Wet Grass Example

::: columns
:::: {.column width=65%}
- Consider the propositions:
  - $Rain$ = "it rains"
  - $WetGrass$ = "the grass is wet"

- You would expect $Rain \implies WetGrass$
::::
:::: {.column width=30%}
![](msml610/lectures_source/figures/Lesson06_grass_sprinkler.png)
::::
:::

- "$Rain \implies WetGrass$" is not true in general
  - If it rains but there is a cover over the grass, the grass will not be wet
  - If it rains but there is high temperature, the wet grass might dry quickly

- "$WetGrass \implies Rain$" is not true in general
  - The grass could be wet because of a sprinkler system
  - The grass could be wet because of morning dew

- You need to consider also the propositions:
  - $Cover$ = "there is a protective cover over the grass"
  - $Evaporate$ = "the water evaporates quickly"
  - $Sprinkler$ = "the sprinkler system is on"
  - $Dew$ = "there is morning dew"

* Failure of Logic-Based AI: Wet Grass Example

- Identify all exceptions and dependencies to make $X \implies Y$:
  1. **Causal**
     - "If it rains and there is no other source of water, the grass will be wet"
     - $Rain \implies WetGrass \lor Cover \lor Evaporate \ldots$
     - $Rain \land \lnot (Cover \land Evaporate ...) \implies WetGrass$
  2. **Exhaustive**
     - "The grass is wet, if it rains or sprinkler is on or there is morning dew"
     - $WetGrass \implies Rain \lor Sprinkler \lor Dew \ldots$
```graphviz
digraph BayesianFlow {
    splines=true;
    nodesep=1.0;
    ranksep=0.75;

    node [shape=box, style="rounded,filled", fontname="Helvetica", fontsize=12, penwidth=1.7];

    // Nodes
    Rain       [label="Rain", fillcolor="#A6C8F4"];
    WetGrass   [label="WetGrass", fillcolor="#B2E2B2"];
    Cover      [label="Cover", fillcolor="#FFD1A6"];
    Evaporate  [label="Evaporate", fillcolor="#F4A6A6"];
    Sprinkler  [label="Sprinkler", fillcolor="#A0D6D1"];
    Dew        [label="Dew", fillcolor="#A6E7F4"];

    // Force ranks
    { rank=same; Cover; Evaporate; }
    { rank=same; Sprinkler; Dew; }

    // Edges
    Rain -> WetGrass;
    Rain -> Cover;
    Rain -> Evaporate;
    Cover -> WetGrass [label="blocks", style=dashed];
    Evaporate -> WetGrass [label="blocks", style=dashed];
    Sprinkler -> WetGrass;
    Dew -> WetGrass;
}
```

* Acting Under Uncertainty: Actual Solution
- Can't use propositional logic under uncertainty

- Acting under uncertainty requires combining:
  - **Probability**: to handle uncertainty and partial knowledge
  - **Utilities**: for evaluating desirability of each outcome

- **Key idea:**
  - Rational choice = plan that maximizes expected utility
    - Performance measure: combines goals like punctuality, comfort, legal
      compliance
    - Belief: agent's internal estimate of outcome likelihoods
  - Evaluate plans based on performance on average, given known information
  - But success is not guaranteed!

* The Paradox of Probability and Knowledge
- **Paradox**
  - _"There is no uncertainty in the actual world!"_
  - E.g., the grass is wet, but either it has rained or not

- **Knowledge is subjective**
  - Probabilities relate to a knowledge state, not to the real world
  - Updating knowledge changes probability statements

* The Paradox of Probability and Knowledge
- E.g., updating belief about wet grass and rain

- Initially, you observe wet grass
  - From past data you know that $\Pr(Rain | WetGrass) = 0.8$
  - 80% chance it rained if grass is wet
  - This is the Bayesian prior

- You learn new information:
  - Sprinkler was on
  - Wet grass could be due to the sprinkler, not rain
  - Belief changes: $\Pr(Rain | WetGrass \land Sprinkler) = 0.4$
  - This is a Bayesian update

- You further observe:
  - Weather report says there was no rain
  - Certain it did not rain, despite wet grass
  - Evidence overrides prior: $\Pr(Rain | WetGrass \land WeatherReport) = 0$

- All the statements were true even if contradictory (given the state of
  knowledge!)
  - You need non-monotonic logic

* Full Joint Probability Distribution

- Consider a set of random variables $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$

- The **full joint probability distribution**
  - Assigns a probability to every possible world:
    $$
    \Pr(X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, \dots, X_n = x_n)
    $$
    where a **possible world** is a particular assignment of values to all
    variables
  - Can answer any probabilistic query about the domain

- **Cons**
  - Size grows exponentially $k^n$ with the number of variables $n$ and number of
    values $k$
  - Impractical for real-world problems with many variables
  - Manually specifying each entry is tedious

- **Independence** (conditional and absolute) simplifies modeling
  - In the real world, many variables are not fully dependent on all others
  - Reduces the number of variables needed in the model
  - Makes compact and structured representations possible
    - E.g., factorized probabilistic models, Bayesian networks

* Independence of Random Variables: Definition
- Two random variables $X$ and $Y$ are **independent** iff:
  $$
  \Pr(X, Y) = \Pr(X) \cdot \Pr(Y)
  $$
  - Equivalently, knowing $Y$ tells nothing about $X$
  $$
  \Pr(X | Y) = \Pr(X)
  $$
- E.g.,
  - The events "coin flip" and "weather" are independent
    $$
    \Pr(Coin=Heads | Weather=Rainy) = \Pr(Coin=Heads)
    $$

- **Independence** of random variables
  - Reduces the number of parameters needed to model a system, e.g.,
    $$
    \Pr(X_1 | X_2, X_3) = \Pr(X_1)
    $$
  - Allows factorization of joint distribution, e.g.,
    $$
    \Pr(X_1, X_2, X_3) = \Pr(X_1) \cdot \Pr(X_2) \cdot \Pr(X_3)
    $$

* Conditional Independence: Definition
- Two random variables $X$ and $Y$ are **conditionally independent** given a
  random variable $Z$ iff knowing $Z$ makes $X$ and $Y$ independent:
  $$
  X \perp Y | Z \iff \Pr(X, Y | Z) = \Pr(X | Z) \cdot \Pr(Y | Z)
  $$

- **Example**
  - $X$ = _"it is raining today"_
  - $Y$ = _"a person is carrying an umbrella"_
  - $Z$ = _"the weather forecast"_
  - **Without $Z$**: there is a relationship between $X$ and $Y$ (i.e., $X$ and
    $Y$ are not independent)
  - **Given $Z$**: rain $X$ may not directly influence whether a person carries
    an umbrella $Y$
  - Thus, $X$ and $Y$ are conditionally independent given $Z$

- **Pros**
  - Conditional independence is more common than absolute independence
  - Simplify probabilistic models by factorizing the joint conditional
    distribution into product of individual conditional distributions

* Conditional Independence: Example

::: columns
:::: {.column width=65%}
- Two events can become independent once we know a third event

- **Example**
  - $Fire$ = _"there is a fire"_
  - $Toast$ = _"someone burned toast"_
  - $Alarm$ = _"the fire alarm rings"_
  - $Call$ = _"a friend calls to check on you"_

- **Dependencies**
  - $Alarm$ depends on $Fire$ or $Toast$
  - $Call$ depends on whether $Alarm$ rings

- **Conditional independence**
  - Once we know the alarm rang, the specific cause doesn't affect whether the
    friend calls
  - $\Pr(Call \mid Alarm, Fire) = \Pr(Call \mid Alarm)$

::::
:::: {.column width=30%}
```graphviz
digraph BayesianFlow {
    splines=true;
    nodesep=1.0;
    ranksep=0.75;

    node [shape=box, style="rounded,filled", fontname="Helvetica", fontsize=12, penwidth=1.4];

    Fire   [label="Fire",       fillcolor="#F4A6A6"];
    Toast  [label="Toast",      fillcolor="#FFD1A6"];
    Alarm  [label="Alarm",      fillcolor="#A6E7F4"];
    Call   [label="Call",       fillcolor="#A6C8F4"];

    { rank = same; Fire; Toast; }
    { rank = same; Call; }

    Fire  -> Alarm;
    Toast -> Alarm;
    Alarm -> Call;
}
```
::::
:::
- **Interpretation**
  - $Call$ is conditionally independent of $Fire$ and $Toast$ given $Alarm$
  - Knowing the alarm rang "blocks" the path of influence from $Fire$ and $Toast$
    to $Call$

* Conditional Independence: Garden Example

- Garden world with $Rain$, $Sprinkler$, and $WetGrass$
  - Is $\Pr(Rain | Sprinkler) = \Pr(Rain)$ ?
    - **No**: if the sprinkler is on, it's less likely it rained
    - $Rain$ and $Sprinkler$ are not independent
  - Is $\Pr(Rain | Sprinkler, WetGrass) = \Pr(Rain | WetGrass)$ ?
    - **Yes**: knowing the grass is wet, whether the sprinkler was on tells you
      nothing more about the rain
    - $Rain$ and $Sprinkler$ are conditionally independent given $WetGrass$

::: columns
:::: {.column width=60%}
- **Interpretation**:
  - Without $WetGrass$: $Rain$ and $Sprinkler$ affect each other because they
    both explain $WetGrass$
  - With $WetGrass$: once $WetGrass$ is observed, the "explaining away" effect
    occurs
::::
:::: {.column width=35%}

```graphviz
digraph BayesianFlow {
    splines=true;
    nodesep=1.0;
    ranksep=0.75;

    node [shape=box, style="rounded,filled", fontname="Helvetica", fontsize=12, penwidth=1.4];

    Rain       [label="Rain",       fillcolor="#A6C8F4"];
    Sprinkler  [label="Sprinkler",  fillcolor="#FFD1A6"];
    WetGrass   [label="WetGrass",   fillcolor="#B2E2B2"];

    { rank = same; Rain; Sprinkler; }

    Rain      -> WetGrass;
    Sprinkler -> WetGrass;

    // Added dotted arrows between Rain and Sprinkler
    Rain -> Sprinkler [style=dashed];
    Sprinkler -> Rain [style=dashed];
}
```
::::
:::

- **"Explaining away" occurs when**
  - Two variables (causes) independently influence a third variable (effect)
  - Observing the effect creates a dependence between the causes
  - Evidence for one explains the effect and reduces the need to believe in the
    other

## Bayesian Networks

* Bayesian Networks: Definition
- Aka:
  - "Bayes nets",
  - "Belief networks"
  - "Probabilistic networks"
  - "Graphical models" (somehow a broader class of statistical models)
  - "Causal networks" (arrows have special meaning)

- A **Bayesian network** is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
  1. **Nodes** $X_i$ correspond to random variables (discrete or continuous)
  2. **Edges** $X \to Y$ connect nodes and represent direct dependencies among
     variables
     - We say that $X = Parent(Y)$, $Y = Child(X)$, ancestors, spouses, ...
  3. Each node $X_i$ is associated with a **conditional probability** (CPD):
     $$
     \Pr(X_i | Parents(X_i))
     $$
     quantifying the effect of the parents on the node
     - If a node has no parents, it has a prior probability

// TODO: Add example graph

* Bayesian Network: Intuition
- Bayesian networks are the analogous for uncertain knowledge to propositional
  logic for definite knowledge
  - \red{Propositional logic} = rigid rules, i.e., `True` or `False`
  - \blue{Bayesian networks} = flexible inference, i.e., degrees of belief
  - Replace $X \implies Y$ with $\Pr(Y | X)$

- E.g., wet grass example
  - $R$ = "It is raining"
  - $W$ = "The grass is wet"
  - \red{Propositional logic}
    - If $R \rightarrow W$ and $R$ is true, then $W$ must be true
  - \blue{Bayesian network}
    - $\Pr(R = True) = 0.2$
    - $\Pr(W | R) = 0.9$
    - $\Pr(W | \neg R) = 0.1$

- E.g., medical diagnosis
  - \red{Propositional logic}
    - "Patient has disease $D$" $\implies$ "Patient has symptom $S$"
  - \blue{Bayesian network}
    - "Probability of $S$ given $D$ is high, but not certain"

* Bayesian Network and Full-joint distribution
- It can be shown that **topology** and **conditional probabilities** are
  sufficient to specify the full joint distribution
    - **Any full joint** distribution
    - **Very concisely** (often)

- Nodes are:
  - Directly influenced by their parents
  - Indirectly influenced by all their ancestors

- The topology of the network (nodes and edges) specifies conditional
  independence relationships
  - E.g., $X \to Y$ means _"$X$ has a direct influence on $Y$"_, i.e., _"$X$
    relates to $Y$"_ (not necessarily "causes")

- How to build a Bayesian Network:
  - Domain experts can decide what relationships exist among domain variables,
    determining the topology
  - Conditional probabilities can be specified or estimated

* Bayesian Networks: Wet Grass Example

::: columns
:::: {.column width=50%}
- Consider a world with 5 variables
  - $Weather$
    - Represents general environmental conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy)
    - Can't be observed
  - $Rain$
    - Directly influenced by $Weather$
  - $Sprinkler$
    - Influenced by $Weather$ (e.g., less likely when raining)
  - $WetGrass$
    - Represents whether the grass is wet
    - Affected by both $Rain$ and $Sprinkler$
  - $StockMarketUp$
    - Indicates whether the stock market is up or down

* Bayesian Networks: Wet Grass Example
::: columns
:::: {.column width=60%}
- $Rain$ and $Sprinkler$ are **dependent** (marginally)
  $$Rain \not\perp Sprinkler \iff Rain \leftrightarrow Sprinkler$$
  - If there is no $Rain$, $Weather = sunny$ and $Sprinkler$ is more likely to
    happen (since sprinklers are usually turned on in sunny weather)
  - $Rain$ and $Sprinkler$ are related since they share a common parent $Weather$

- $Rain$ and $Sprinkler$ are **conditionally independent** given $Weather$
  $$Rain \perp Sprinkler | Weather$$
  - Once $Weather$ is fixed, knowing whether it rained tells you nothing about
    the $Sprinkler$
  - The correlation is "explained away" by $Weather$

* Bayesian Networks: Wet Grass Example
::: columns
:::: {.column width=60%}
- $Rain$ and $Sprinkler$ are **conditionally independent** given $WetGrass$,
  but only if $Weather$ is not observed
  $$Rain \perp Sprinkler | WetGrass (not Weather)$$
  - If we condition on $WetGrass$, i.e., the grass is wet, knowing that the
    sprinkler was off increases the chances that it must have rained (and vice
    versa)

  $$Rain \not\perp Sprinkler | WetGrass, Weather$$
  - If you know that it's sunny, rain is unlikely and sprinkler likely
  - If you also know that $WetGrass$
    - If you learn $Sprinkler$ off $\implies$ must have $Rain$
  - Fork path (common cause) and collider path (common effect)

- $StockMarketUp$ is **(unconditionally) independent** of all other variables

* Conditional Probability Table
- **Conditional Probability Table** (CPT) encodes the probability of one node
  $X_i$ given its parents $Parents(X_i)$
  $$
  \Pr(X_i | Parents(X_i))
  $$

- Each row of the CPT contains the conditional probability of the node under a
  conditioning case (i.e., a possible combination of the values for the parent
  nodes)

- E.g., $\Pr(A | B, C)$

\begingroup \scriptsize
| **A**    | **P(A\|B,C)** | **P(A\|B,-C)** | **P(A\|-B,C)**  | **P(A\|-B,-C)**|
| ---------|---------------| ---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| True     | 0.80          | 0.10           | 0.05            | 0.05 |
| False    | 0.05          | 0.85           | 0.10            | 0.0 |
\endgroup

- **Note**:
  - Natural for discrete variables, but can be extended to continuous variables
  - A conditional probability table summarizes an infinite set of circumstances
    in the table

* Bayesian Networks: Burglar Example

- Famous example from Judea Pearl

- An $Alarm$ system installed at a home in LA
  - Fairly reliable at detecting $Burglary$
  - Also responds to minor $Earthquakes$ (false positive)

- Two neighbors, $John$ and $Mary$ will $Call$ you when they hear the $Alarm$
  - $John$:
    - Almost always $Call$s when he hears the alarm
    - Sometimes confuses telephone with the $Alarm$ and $Call$s (false positives)
  - $Mary$:
    - Misses the alarm 30% of the cases (false negatives)

::: columns
:::: {.column width=60%}
- The **structure of the graph** shows that:
  - $Burglary$ and $Earthquake$ affects the event $Alarm$
  - $JohnCalls$ and $MaryCalls$ depend only on the $Alarm$, and not on
    $Burglary$ and $Earthquake$
::::

## Semantics of Bayesian Networks

// ## 13.2 The semantics of Bayesian networks (p. 427)

* Bayesian Networks: Semantics

- There are **two equivalent semantic interpretations** of a Bayesian Network

  1. **Joint Distribution View**
     - The network encodes the _joint probability distribution_ over all
       variables
     - Computed as the product of local conditional probabilities:
       $$
       P(X_1, ..., X_n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i \mid \text{Parents}(X_i))
       $$
     - Useful for constructing models and understanding overall behavior

  2. **Conditional Independence View**
     - The structure encodes _conditional independency_ between variables
     - Useful for inference and reasoning
     - A variable is conditionally independent of its non-descendants given its
       parents

// ### Representing the full joint distribution (p. 533)

* Chain Rule for a Joint Distribution
- A **joint distribution** can always be expressed using the chain rule for any:
  - Subset of its RVs
  - Ordering of the RVs

1. You **express one variable** conditionally to the remaining ones
   $$
   \Pr(\blue{x_1, ..., x_{n-1}}, \red{x_n})
   = \Pr(\red{x_n} | \blue{x_{n-1}, ..., x_1}) \Pr(\blue{x_{n-1}, ..., x_1})
   $$

2. Apply the same formula **recursively**, until you get an unconditional
   probability
   \begingroup \small
   \begin{align*}
   & \Pr(\gray{x_1}, \violet{x_2}, ..., \teal{x_{n-2}}, \olive{x_{n-1}}, \orange{x_n}) \\
   & = \Pr(\orange{x_n} | x_{n-1}, ..., x_1) \Pr(x_{n-1}, ..., x_1) \\
   & = \Pr(\orange{x_n} | x_{n-1}, ..., x_1)
   \Pr(\olive{x_{n-1}} | x_{n-2}, ..., x_1) \Pr(x_{n-2}, ..., x_1) \\
   & ... \\
   & = \Pr(\orange{x_n} | x_{n-1}, ..., x_1)
   \Pr(\olive{x_{n-1}} | x_{n-2}, ..., x_1) \Pr(\teal{x_{n-2}} | x_{n-3}, ..., x_1)
   ...
   \Pr(\violet{x_2} | x_1) \Pr(\gray{x_1}) \\
   & = \prod_{i=1}^n \Pr(x_i | x_{i-1}, ..., x_1) \\
   \end{align*}
   \endgroup

* Statement Probability from Bayesian Network
- The **full joint distribution** represents the probability of an assignment to
  each variable $X_i = x_i$:
  $$\Pr(x_1, ..., x_n) \defeq \Pr(X_1 = x_1 \land ... \land X_n = x_n)$$

- To **evaluate a Bayesian network**
  - Sort the nodes in topological order
    - There are several orderings consistent with the directed graph structure
  - Use the chain rule with the topological ordering:
    $$
    \Pr(X_1, ..., X_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n \Pr(X_i | X_{i-1}, ..., X_1)
    $$
  - Since the probability of each node is conditionally independent of all its
    predecessors given its parents
    $$
    \Pr(X_i | X_{i-1}, ..., X_1) = \Pr(X_i | Parents(X_i))
    $$
  - Express the joint probability in terms of the Conditional Probability Tables
    (CPTs):
    $$
    \Pr(X_1, ..., X_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n \Pr(X_i | Parents(X_i))
    $$

* Statement Probability From Bayes Nets: Example
::: columns
:::: {.column width=60%}
- Given Pearl LA example, you want to compute the probability that:
  - The alarm has sounded: $Alarm$
  - Neither a burglary nor an earthquake has occurred:
    $\lnot Burglary \land \lnot Earthquake$
  - Both John and Mary call: $JohnCalls, MaryCalls$
::::
:::: {.column width=35%}
```graphviz
digraph BayesianNetwork {
    node [shape=ellipse, style=filled, fillcolor=lightblue];

    Burglary [label="Burglary", xlabel="P(B) = 0.001"];
    Earthquake [label="Earthquake", xlabel="P(E) = 0.002"];
    Alarm [label="Alarm", xlabel="P(A | B,E)"];
    JohnCalls [label="JohnCalls", xlabel="P(J | A)"];
    MaryCalls [label="MaryCalls", xlabel="P(M | A)"];

    Burglary -> Alarm;
    Earthquake -> Alarm;
    Alarm -> JohnCalls;
    Alarm -> MaryCalls;
}
```
::::
:::

- **Solution**
  - Compute the probability as a product of conditional probabilities from the
    Bayesian Network
  \begin{align*}
  & \Pr(JohnCalls, MaryCalls, Alarm, \lnot Burglary, \lnot Earthquake) \\
  & = \Pr(JohnCalls|Alarm) \cdot \\
  & \hspace{1cm} \Pr(MaryCalls|Alarm) \cdot \\
  & \hspace{1cm} \Pr(Alarm|\lnot Burglary \land \lnot Earthquake) \cdot \\
  & \hspace{1cm} \Pr(\lnot Burglary) \cdot \Pr(\lnot Earthquake) \\
  \end{align*}

## Constructing a Bayesian Network

* Constructing a Bayesian Network
1. **Gather domain knowledge**
   - Identify key variables and their potential interactions
   - List all relevant random variables necessary to describe the system

2. **Order the nodes** according to cause-effects dependencies
   - So that the Bayesian network is minimal

3. For each node, **pick the minimum set of parents** $Parents(X_i)$
   - Add edges to represent the dependencies
   - Avoid redundant connections

4. **Estimate the conditional probability** $\Pr(X_i | Parents(X_i))$ for each
   node
   - Gather data or expert opinion
   - Use statistical techniques if necessary

5. **Validate the model**
   - Have domain experts review it
   - Ensure that the network is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
   - Test the network by predicting known outcomes and comparing with actual data

* Bayesian Networks: Properties
- Bayesian networks are a representation with several interesting properties
  - **Complete**
    - Encode all information in a joint probability
  - **Consistent** (non-redundant)
    - In a Bayesian network, there are no redundant probability values
    - One (e.g., a domain expert) can't create a Bayesian network violating
      probability axioms
  - **Compact** (locally structured, sparse)
    - Each subcomponent interacts directly with a limited number of other
      components
    - Typically yields linear (not exponential) growth in complexity
    - Sometimes we ignore real-world dependency to keep the graph simple

- In **fully connected systems**
  - Each variable is influenced by all others
  - The Bayesian network has the same complexity as the joint probability

* Ordering of Nodes
- The complexity of the Bayesian network depends on the choice in ordering the
  nodes

::: columns
:::: {.column width=65%}
- A **causal model** goes from causes to symptoms

  - E.g., $MaryCalls \to Alarm$ or $Alarm \to Burglary$
  - Tenuous / unstable
  - Difficult to estimate

* How Can a Node Be Influenced by Its Children?

  - Information flows both ways in Bayesian networks

::: columns

- E.g.,
  - Consider the Garden World
  - You know the grass is wet $WetGrass$
  - This evidence increases the probability of either causes $Rain$ or

  - If you find out that the $Sprinkler$ was on, this "explains away" the

// ### 13.2.2, Efficient representation of conditional distributions (p. 433)

* Specifying a Conditional Probability Table
- Conditional Probability Table (CPT) for a node requires $O(2^k)$ values in the
  worst case
  - Difficult to specify even with a small number of parents $k$

- Often, the relationship is not completely arbitrary, e.g.,
  - Deterministic nodes
  - Noisy logical relationships
  - Context-specific independence

* Deterministic Nodes
- **Deterministic nodes** have values specified by their parents, without
  uncertainty, e.g.,
  - A logical relationship:
    - Useful when a condition is met if any of the sub-conditions are true
    - $IsNorthAmerican = IsCanadian \lor IsUS \lor IsMexican$
  - A numerical relationship:
    - $BestPrice = \min(Price_i)$

- **Note**
  - Deterministic nodes do not involve randomness or probability
  - Often used in models to simplify relationships and computations

* Noisy Logical Relationships
- **Noisy logical relationships** (e.g., noisy-OR, noisy-MAX):
  - Are a probabilistic version of a logical relationship
  - Can be simpler to describe given $k$ parents

- **Example**
- In propositional logic
  $$Fever \iff Cold \lor Flu \lor Malaria$$

- In Bayesian networks
  - The assumptions are:
    1. All the possible causes are listed (you can use a leak node for "misc
       causes")
    2. There is uncertainty about the parents to cause the child node
    3. The probabilities of parents are independent
  - Under these assumptions:
    \begin{align*}
    &\Pr(Fever | parents(Fever)) \\
    & \hspace{1cm} = 1 - \Pr(\lnot Fever | Cold, \lnot Flu, \lnot Malaria) \cdot \\
    & \hspace{1cm} \Pr(\lnot Fever | \lnot Cold, Flu, \lnot Malaria) \cdot \\
    & \hspace{1cm} \Pr(\lnot Fever | \lnot Cold, \lnot Flu, Malaria)
    \end{align*}

* Context-specific Independence
- A variable exhibits **context-specific independence** if it is conditionally
  independent of its parents given certain values of others

- **Example**
  - $Damage$ occurs depending on the $Ruggedness$ of your car and whether an
    $Accident$ occurred in that period:
    \begingroup \scriptsize
    $$
    \Pr(Damage \mid Ruggedness, Accident) =
    \begin{cases}
    d_1 & \text{if } Accident = True \\
    d_2(Ruggedness) & \text{if } Accident = False
    \end{cases}
    $$
    \endgroup
    where $d1$ and $d2$ are distributions

* Bayesian Networks with Continuous Variables
- Many real world problems involve continuous quantities
  - E.g., height, mass, temperature, money

- **Problem**: Conditional Probability Table (CPT) is not suitable for continuous RVs

- **Solution**:
  1. Discretization (i.e., use intervals)
     - Cons: loss of accuracy and large CPTs
  2. Continuous variables
     - Families of probability density functions (e.g., Gaussian distribution)
     - Non-parametric PDFs

- **Hybrid Bayesian networks** mix discrete and continuous variables, e.g.,
  - A customer buys a number of apples (discrete) depending on its cost
    (continuous)
  - Decide annual premium to charge to insure a vehicle based on applicant
    information (e.g., make model)

* Bayesian Network: Car Insurance Company (1/2)
- A **car insurance company**:
  - Receive an application from an individual to insure a specific vehicle
  - Analyze information about the individual and its car
  - Decide on appropriate annual premium to charge
  - Pay out a claim, based on the type of claim

- Build a Bayesian network that captures the causal structure of the domain

  - **Input information**:
    - About the applicant: $Age$, $YearsWithLicense$, $DrivingRecord$,
      $GoodStudent$
    - About the vehicle: $MakeModel$, $VehicleYear$, $Airbag$, $SafetyFeatures$
    - About the driving situation: $Mileage$, $HasGarage$
  - Some input informations are **important but not available**:
    - $RiskAversion$
    - $DrivingBehavior$
  - **Type of claims**:
    - $MedicalCost$: injuries sustained by the applicant
    - $LiabilityCost$: lawsuits filed by other parties against applicant
    - $PropertyCost$: vehicle damage to either party and theft of the vehicle

## Exact Inference in Bayesian Networks

// ## 13.3 Exact inference in Bayesian networks (p. 440)

* Exact Inference in Bayesian Networks

- **Goal of exact inference**
  - Compute the posterior $P(X|\vE=\ve)$ for query variable $X$ given evidence
    $\ve$

- **Variables involved**
  - Query variable $X$
  - Evidence variables $\vE = \{E_1, \dots, E_m\}$
  - Hidden variables $\vY = \{Y_1, \dots, Y_\ell\}$

- **Inference by Enumeration**
  - Use full joint distribution and sum over all hidden variables:
    $$P(X|e) = \alpha \sum_Y P(X,e,Y)$$

- **Variable Elimination**
  - Improves efficiency by caching intermediate results
  - Eliminates variables systematically to avoid redundant sums
  - Removing irrelevant variables
    - Variables not ancestors of query or evidence can be ignored

- **Problems**
  - Exact inference is efficient $O(n)$ for trees, but intractable $O(2^n)$ in
    general
  - It doesn't work for continuous variables
  - Basis for approximate methods when exact is impractical

* Exact Inference in Bayesian Networks: Example
- You get a call from both John and Mary, what is the probability of the
  burglary?
  $$P(Burglary | JohnCalls=True, MaryCalls=True)$$

- A conditional probability can be computed summing terms from the full joint
  distribution
  $$\Pr(X | \ve) = \alpha \Pr(X, \ve) = \alpha \sum_y \Pr(X, \ve, \vy)$$

- Terms of the joint distribution can be written as products of conditional
  probabilities from the Bayesian network
  $$
  \Pr(b | j, m)
  = \alpha \Pr(B, j, m)
  = \alpha \sum_e \sum_a \Pr(B, j, m, e, a)
  $$
- Then the joint probability is written in terms of CPTs of the Bayesian network
  $$
  \Pr(b | j, m)
  = \alpha \sum_e \sum_a \Pr(b) \Pr(e) \Pr(a | b, e) \Pr(j | a) \Pr(m | a)
  $$

## Approximate Inference in Bayesian Networks

* Monte Carlo Algorithms
- **Monte Carlo algorithms** are randomized sampling algorithms used to estimate
  quantities that are difficult to calculate exactly
  - E.g., samples from the posterior probability of a Bayes network

- **Pros**
  - The accuracy of the approximation depends on the number of samples generated
  - You can get arbitrarily close to the true probability distribution with
    enough samples
  - Is used in many branches of science

- **Cons**
  - Difficult to understand how the variables interact
  - Computationally intensive

### Direct sampling methods

* Sampling from Arbitrary Distributions

- **Goal**: Sample from a discrete or continuous probability distribution

- **Solution**
  - Start with uniform random numbers $r \in [0, 1]$
  - Construct CDF (cumulative distribution function) $F(x)$
    - $F(x) = \Pr(X \leq x)$
  - For discrete distributions:
    - Create table of outcomes and cumulative probabilities
    - Find smallest outcome where $F(x) > r$
  - For continuous distributions:
    - Use inverse transform: $x = F^{-1}(r)$, e.g.,
      $$
      F(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x} \to x = F^{-1}(r) = -\frac{1}{\lambda} \ln(1 - r)
      $$
    - If $F^{-1}$ has no closed form, use numerical methods

// TODO(gp): Make an example.

* Sampling Bayesian Network Without Evidence

- **Goal**: Generate events from a Bayesian network without evidence (prior sampling)

::: columns
:::: {.column width=60%}
- **Solution**
  - Sample variables in topological order (to ensure parents have values)
  - Source nodes have known unconditional probability distribution
    - E.g., $\Pr(Rain) = 0.5$
  - Conditional variable's probability distribution depends on parent's values
    - E.g., $\Pr(WetGrass | Rain = T) = 0.1$
  - Implement Bayesian network semantics, representing joint probability:
    $$
    f_{PS}(x_1, ..., x_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n \Pr(x_i | parents(X_i))
    $$
    where $PS$ means "Prior Sampling"

::::
:::: {.column width=35%}

```graphviz
digraph BayesianFlow {
    splines=true;
    nodesep=1.0;
    ranksep=0.75;

    node [shape=box, style="rounded,filled", fontname="Helvetica", fontsize=12, penwidth=1.4];

    Rain       [label="Rain",       fillcolor="#A6C8F4"];
    Sprinkler  [label="Sprinkler",  fillcolor="#FFD1A6"];
    WetGrass   [label="WetGrass",   fillcolor="#B2E2B2"];

    { rank = same; Rain; Sprinkler; }

    Rain      -> WetGrass;
    Sprinkler -> WetGrass;
}
```
::::
:::

* Consistency of Sampling
- **Consistency of estimation**: distribution from prior sampling converges to
  true probability as $N \to \infty$

- If $N_{PS}$ is the number of times event $x_1, ..., x_n$ occurs:
  $$
  \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{N_{PS}(x_1, ..., x_n)}{N}
  = \Pr(x_1, ..., x_n)
  $$

- Estimate probability using:
  $$
  \Pr(x_1, ..., x_n) \approx \frac{N_{PS}(x_1, ..., x_n)}{N}
  $$
  - Converges with rate $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$

* Rejection Sampling
::: columns
:::: {.column width=50%}
- **Rejection sampling** is a method for sampling from a hard-to-sample
  distribution

- **Goal**: Compute $\Pr(X=x| E=e)$ when evidence $e$ is rare
  1. Generate samples from the prior distribution
     - Estimate $\Pr(x, e)$
  2. Reject samples not matching evidence, i.e., $X \land E \neq e$
     - Remaining samples $X \land E=e$ estimate $\Pr(X, E=e)$
  3. Count occurrences of $X=x$ in remaining samples $X \land E=e$
     - Estimate $\Pr(X=x | E=e)$

::::
:::: {.column width=45%}

![](msml610/lectures_source/figures/Lesson06_Rejection_Sampling.png)

::::
:::

- **Example**:
  - You want to estimate $\Pr(Rain | Sprinkler = T)$
  - Sample 100 times
    - You get 73 samples with $\lnot Sprinkler$ and they are rejected
    - You are left with 27 samples with $Sprinkler$
    - Out of them only 8 have $Rain$ and 19 have $\lnot Rain$
  - Thus:
    $$
    \Pr(Rain | Sprinkler) = \frac{8}{27}
    $$

* Rejection Sampling: Pros and Cons
- **Pros**
  - Consistent estimate
    - Converges to true value as number of samples increases

- **Cons**
  - Many samples are rejected, depending on rarity of $\Pr(E=e)$
  - Fraction of samples matching evidence $e$ decreases exponentially with more
    evidence variables
    - Curse of dimensionality
    - Not suitable for complex systems
  - Difficult with continuous variables
    - E.g., $\Pr(E=e)$ is theoretically 0 due to limited floating-point precision

* Importance Sampling
::: columns
:::: {.column width=60%}

- **Importance sampling**
  - Draw samples from "easier" distribution $Q(X)$
  - Weight each sample by importance weight $w = \frac{\Pr(X)}{Q(X)}$
  - Estimate probability by averaging weighted samples:
    $$
    E[f(X)] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N w_i f(X_i)
    $$ :::: ::::
    {.column width=35%}
    ![](msml610/lectures_source/figures/Lesson06_Importance_Sampling.png) ::::
    :::

- **Example**:
  - Estimate $\Pr(A | E=e)$ where $E$ is rare
  - Standard sampling might miss $E=e$
  - Importance sampling focuses samples near $E=e$ with reweighting
  - Analogy: Rebalance biased survey by giving underrepresented groups higher
    weights

- **Pros**
  - Improves inference efficiency over rejection sampling

* Markov Chain Monte Carlo
- This is one of the top 10 most mind blowing algorithms in history
  - Euclide's GCD
  - Fundamental theorem of calculus
  - Quicksort
  - Fast Fourier Transform
  - Viterbi algorithm
  - MCMC sampling
  - Kalman filter
  - RSA Algorithm
  - ...
- Invented by Ulam, Von Neumann, Metropolis and others during the Manhattan
  Project (1940)
  - Used to solve high-dimensional integrals, Bayesian inference, ...

- **Purpose**: Approximate inference for Bayesian networks when exact inference
  is hard
  - MCMC differs from rejection and importance sampling
  - Make random changes to preceding sample instead of generating each sample
    independently
  - **Magic**: two very different objects (Markov Chains) and Bayesian Networks
    are connected

* Markov Chain Construction
- A **Markov chain** is a "random walk" through states, where the future depends
  only on the present
  - _Sequence of states_: $\vx^{(0)}, \vx^{(1)}, \vx^{(2)}, \dots$
  - _Initial state_: starting configuration
  - _Transition probabilities_: $\Pr(\vx \to \vx')$
  - After $t$ steps, distribution is $\pi_t(\vx)$
  - When $\pi_t(\vx) = \pi_{t+1}(\vx)$, chain reaches stationary distribution

- **Transition operator**: moves from one state to another:
  - Gibbs sampling: resample one variable given its Markov blanket
  - Metropolis–Hastings: propose a new state, then accept/reject based on a
    probability ratio

- There are algorithms generate a Markov Chain from a Bayesian network

- Under certain conditions:
  - Ergodicity: chain can reach any state
  - Aperiodicity: chain does not get stuck in cycles
  stationary distribution equals the **posterior distribution** over non-evidence
  variables given evidence

* Markov Chain Monte Carlo: Mixing
::: columns
:::: {.column width=60%}
- **Mixing** describes how quickly a Markov chain forgets its starting point and
  explores the whole state space efficiently
  - A well-mixed chain:
    - Moves between different high-probability regions often
    - Has low correlation between successive samples
  - Poor mixing:
    - Chain gets stuck in one mode for a long time
    - Leads to biased estimates and high variance

- In practice:
  - Discard initial samples as a burn-in period (before convergence)
  - After convergence, collected samples approximate the true posterior

- **Example**
  - If sampling from a bimodal distribution:
    - "Poor mixing" means the chain stays in one peak
    - "Good mixing" jumps between both peaks to reflect the true posterior

:::

* Gibbs Sampling in Bayesian Networks
- Special case of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that samples one
  variable at a time

- **Algorithm**:
  - Start with an initial complete assignment to all non-evidence variables
  - Keep evidence variables fixed at observed values
  - For each non-evidence variable $X_i$:
    - Sample $X_i$ from $P(X_i | \text{MB}(X_i))$ where $\text{MB}(X_i)$ is
      the Markov blanket, i.e., parents, children, spouse of a node

- **Example**:
  - Weather network: $P(Cloudy | Sprinkler, Rain, WetGrass)$
  - Fix $WetGrass = true$, $Sprinkler = true$
  - Sample $Cloudy$ and $Rain$ iteratively

- **Pros**
  - Simple to implement for any Bayesian network
  - Handles large, complex graphs with local updates

- **Cons**
  - Can mix slowly if variables are highly correlated
  - May need many samples for accurate estimates

* Metropolis–Hastings Sampling
- More general Markov Chain Monte Carlo method than Gibbs sampling

- **Algorithm**
  - Start at a current state $\vx$
  - Propose a new state $\vx'$ from a proposal distribution $q(x' | x)$, e.g.,
    - With 95% probability Gibbs sampling
    - Otherwise use importance sampling
  - Compute the acceptance probability:
    - $A(x, x') = \min(1, \frac{\pi(x')q(x|x')}{\pi(x)q(x'|x)})$
  - Move to $x'$ with probability $A(x,x')$, otherwise stay at $x$

- **Intuition**
  - Propose local moves
  - Accept if they lead to higher probability, or sometimes accept
    lower-probability states to explore
  - Balances exploration and exploitation to avoid getting stuck in local modes

- **Pros**
  - Very flexible: works with any proposal distribution
  - Can handle high-dimensional spaces

- **Cons**
  - May "mix" slowly if proposal steps are poorly chosen
  - Requires careful tuning of proposal distribution for efficiency
