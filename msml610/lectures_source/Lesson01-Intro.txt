* ML, AI, and Intelligence
- Machine Learning is a subset of AI
  - All of it confused with deep learning, large-language models, predictive
    analytics, ...

- What is artificial intelligence?
- What is intelligence?

* Human Intelligence
- We call ourselves "homo sapiens" because intelligence sets us apart from animals

- For thousands of years, we tried to understand how we think

- One of the biggest mysteries
  - Brain is a small mass of matter
  - Our brain can understand nature secrets, e.g., theory of relativity, quantum
    mechanics, black holes in the universe
  - How can brain understand, predict, and manipulate a world more complicated
    than itself?

* Artificial Intelligence
- The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined in 1956

- **AI aims to:**
  - Understand human intelligence
  - Create intelligent entities
  - _"What I cannot create, I do not understand"_ (Feynman, 1988)

- **AI is a technology**
  - Universal and applicable to any human activity and task
  - Its impact greater than any previous historical event
  - Currently generates trillions of dollars annually in revenue
  - Presents many unresolved problems
    - E.g., major concepts in physics might be established

* AI Formal Definition
- AI is defined around **two axes**:
  - Thinking vs. Acting
  - Human vs. Rational (ideal performance)

- Four possible definitions of AI as a machine that can:
  1. Think humanly
  2. Think rationally
  3. Act humanly
  4. Act rationally

- **Q**: Which one do you think is the best definition?

\pause

- We will see that building machines that can **"act rationally"** should be
  ultimate goal of AI

* 1. AI as Thinking Humanly
- To build machines that think like humans we need to **determine how humans
  think**

- **Pros**
  - Express precise theory of the human mind as a computer program

- **Cons**
  - Unknown workings of the human mind
  - Anthropocentric definition

* 2. AI as Thinking Rationally
- What are the rules of **\black{correct thinking}**?
  - Given correct premises, yield correct conclusions

- **Logic** studies the "laws of thought"
  - Formalize statements about objects and their relations

- **Automatic theorem proving**
  - Programs solve problems in logical notation
  - Run indefinitely if no solution exists (related to the halting problem)

* Thinking Rationally: Cons

1. **Formalizing informal knowledge is difficult**
   - Example: _"A handshake occurs when two people extend, grip, shake hands,
     then release."_
   - Formal logic representation: 
     \begin{align*}
         &\exists x, y \, ( \text{Person}(x) \land \text{Person}(y) \land x \neq y \land \\
         &\quad \text{Hand}(x, h_x) \land \text{Hand}(y, h_y) \land \\
         &\quad \text{MoveToward}(h_x, h_y) \land \text{Contact}(h_x, h_y) \land \\
         &\quad \text{Shake}(h_x, h_y) \land \\
         &\quad \text{Release}(h_x, h_y) )
     \end{align*}
2. **Probabilistic nature of knowledge**
   - Example in medicine: _"Fever, cough, and fatigue could indicate flu,
     COVID-19, or another illness."_
3. **Scalability challenges**
   - Large problems may need heuristics for practical solutions
4. **Intelligence requires more than rational thinking**
   - Importance of agent interaction with the world
   - Problem of the "body"

* 3. AI as Acting Humanly
- **Agent** is something that perceives and acts to reach a goal

- **Definition**: AI designs **agents that can act like humans**

- **Turing test**
  - _"A computer passes the Turing test if a human cannot tell whether the
    answers to questions came from a person or a computer"_

::: columns
:::: {.column width=65%}
- Passing the (embodied) Turing test requires:
  1. Natural language processing to communicate
  2. Knowledge representation to store information
  3. Automated reasoning to use stored knowledge and answer questions
  4. Machine learning to detect patterns
  5. Computer vision and speech recognition to perceive objects and understand
     speech
  6. Robotics to manipulate objects and move

* Turing Test: Pros and Cons

- **Pros**
  - Operational definition of intelligence
  - Sidestep philosophical vagueness
    - "What is consciousness?"
    - "Can a machine think?"
    - ...

- **Cons**
  - **Anthropomorphic** criteria define intelligence in human terms
    - Multiple forms of non-human intelligence exist
  - Intelligence in terms of Turing test is **fooling humans** into thinking it's
    human
  - E.g., aeronautical engineering is about:
    - Yes: Focus on wind tunnels and aerodynamics
    - No: Designing machines that imitate birds

* 4. AI as Acting Rationally
- **Rational agents**: agents that do the "right thing" given what they know

- Agents that **act rationally** should:
  1. Operate autonomously
  2. Perceive environment
  3. Persist over a prolonged time period
  4. Adapt to change
  5. Create and pursue goals

* Acting Rationally as Ultimate Goal of AI
- Which definition of AI to use?
  - Acting vs. Thinking
  - Rational vs. Human

\pause

- **Acting > Thinking**
  - Acting rationally is broader than just thinking rationally

- **Rational > Human**
  - Rationality can be mathematically defined
  - Human behavior is shaped by evolutionary conditions

- AI focuses on **agents acting rationally**

* Rationally is Not Absolute

- AI wants to build agents that **do the right thing**
  - What is the right thing?

\pause

- E.g., you leave the house and a branch strikes you
  - **Q**: Did you act rationally?
  \pause
  - Probably

\pause

- E.g., you cross the street and a car knocks you over
  - **Q**: Did you act rationally?
  \pause
  - It depends, but probably no

\pause

- E.g., moral issues with self-driving car 
  - Swerve and hit a pedestrian to avoid a frontal crash that would kill 2 people

* Problems of a Rational Agent
- **Probabilistic environment**
  - A rational agent aims for:
    - The best outcome in a deterministic setup
    - The best expected outcome under uncertainty

- **Best** is determined by the objective function:
  - E.g., cost function, sum of rewards, loss function, utility

- Omniscience vs **no-regrets**
  - Best based on available information

- Sometimes **no provably correct action** exists
  - Yet, an action must be taken

- Even **with perfect information** rationality can't be feasible due to:
  - Cost of acquiring all data (e.g., in medicine)
  - Computational demands

- Perfect good enough vs perfect
  - Acting appropriately ("satisficing")

## #############################################################################
## Machine Learning
## #############################################################################

* Machine Learning: Definitions
- How to define machine learning?

- _"Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to
  learn without being explicitly programmed"_ (Samuel, 1959)

- **Machine learning** is about building machines to do **useful things** without
  being **explicitly programmed**
  - E.g. a computer learns to play checkers by playing against itself, memorizing
    positions that lead to winning

- _"A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some
  task $T$ and some performance measure $P$, if $P(T)$ improves with experience
  $E$"_ (Mitchell, 1998)

- E.g.,
  - Computer vision
  - Speech recognition
  - Natural language processing

* Limits of ML Compared to Human Intelligence
- **AI differs from human intelligence**
  - Machines don't learn like humans (e.g., LLMs)

\pause

- **Fragility to input variations**
  - ML models fail with slight input distortions
    - Adversarial attacks cause misclassification by altering one pixel
    - A model trained for a video game may fail if the screen is slightly
      rotated; humans continue effortlessly

- **Lack of transfer learning**
  - ML systems cannot apply knowledge across domains without retraining

- **Massive data and compute requirements**
  - ML requires enormous datasets and computational resources
    - A teenager learns to drive in hours
    - Self-driving systems need billions of compute hours and extensive data

- **Poor common sense and reasoning**
  - ML lacks built-in world knowledge and intuitive logic

* Limits of ML Compared to Human Intelligence

- **Opaque decision-making**
  - Many ML models offer little transparency into decision processes
    - Limits trust, interpretability, and accountability in critical
      applications

- **Dependence on narrow objectives**
  - ML systems excel at optimizing narrow tasks but fail with ambiguous goals
    - E.g., an algorithm maximizing user engagement may promote harmful
      content

- **Susceptibility to bias and data quality**
  - Models inherit and amplify biases in training data

- **Lack of embodiment and physical interaction**
  - Human cognition is grounded in physical and sensory experience

* The 3 Machine Learning Assumptions

- In practice, ML involves solving a practical problem by:
  - Gathering a dataset
  - Building a statistical model from the dataset algorithmically

- The **three assumptions** of machine learning
  - A **pattern exists**
  - Pattern cannot be **precisely defined mathematically**
  - **Data is available**

- Which ML assumption is **essential**?
  \pause
  - A pattern exists
    - If no pattern, try learning, measure effectiveness, conclude it doesn't
      work
  - Pattern cannot be precisely defined mathematically
    - If solution is direct, ML not recommended, but may still apply
  - Data is available
    - Without data, no progress can be made
    - **Data is crucial**

* The Beginning (1943-1956)
- **Artificial neuron**
  - Model (McCullock-Pitts 1943) based on:
    - Brain physiology
    - Propositional logic
  - Compute any function with connected neurons
    - Neuron on/off based on stimulation from neighboring neurons
    - Implement logical AND, OR, NOT with simple neuron networks

- **Alan Turing, 1947**
  - Turing test, machine learning, reinforcement learning
  - Create human-level AI
    - Develop learning algorithms
    - Teach machine like a child

- **Birth of AI**
  - McCarthy organized first AI workshop (1956)
  - The Logic Theorist (Newell and Simon, 1956)
    - Programs to "think non-numerically" and prove theorems

* Enthusiasm and Great Expectations (1952-1969)
- **Early years of AI were full of successes**
  - Before computers could only do arithmetics
  - _"A machine can never do X (e.g., games, puzzles, IQ tests, ...)"_
    - AI researchers showed machines could do one $X$ after another

- **General Problem Solver**
  - Imitate human problem-solving
  - Consider sub-goals and possible actions

- **Program learned to play checkers**
  - Use reinforcement learning from victories and mistakes

- **Lisp (1958)**
  - High-level language used for 30 years in AI

- **First neural network**
  - 3000 vacuum tubes for 40 neurons
  - Minsky (1959)

- **MIT and Stanford**
  - Minsky at MIT
    - Focus on neural network
  - McCarthy at Stanford
    - Focus on representation, logic

* First AI winter (1975-1980)
- **Early successes** of AI set high expectations

- In 1965-1975 AI didn't succeed on **real problems** due to:
  - Solutions were based on human problem-solving methods
  - Difficulty handling "combinatorial explosion"
    - Theorem proving handles small problems with brute force, but doesn't scale
  - Neural networks needed:
    - Algorithms (e.g., backpropagation)
    - Compute power
    - Data

- **First AI winter**
  - Research funding and enthusiasm dropped significantly
  - Slow AI progress through late 1970s

* Expert Systems (1980-1990)
- **Expert systems**
  - Aka "knowledge-based systems"
  - Combine weak methods with extensive domain knowledge as rules
  - Use inference engines to apply rules to facts
  - E.g., rule-based systems, logic programming (e.g., Prolog)

- **Weak AI**
  - Aka narrow AI
  - Performs specific tasks, not general reasoning
  - Operates in a limited, well-defined domain
  - Uses "weak methods" (search, logic) that struggle to scale

- **Commercial adoption and industry growth**
  - AI shifted to practical applications
  - Major US corporations deployed expert systems
  - AI emerged as a commercial industry

* Second AI Winter (late 1980-early 1990)
- **Hype in expert systems** didn't deliver

- **Reasons**
  - Building/maintaining expert systems is difficult
  - Reasoning methods ignore uncertainty
  - Systems can't learn from experience
  - E.g., expert systems in medical diagnosis struggle with complex, variable
    patient data
  - E.g., early AI chess systems couldn't adapt to new strategies without manual
    updates

- **Second AI winter** in late 1980-early 1990

* Return of Neural Networks (1986-)
- Back-propagation algorithm is (re)discovered (mid-1980s)
  - Developed in early 1960s

- **Two approaches to AI are back**
  - Connectionist paradigm
    - Neural networks
    - E.g., recognizing handwritten digits
  - Symbolic paradigm
    - E.g., solving logical puzzles with rules

- **Why connectionist approach?**
  - Concepts not well-defined using symbolic axioms
    - Forms fluid internal concepts
    - Represents real-world complexity better
  - Neural networks can learn from examples, e.g.,
    - Image recognition: identify objects by learning from labeled images

* Probabilistic Reasoning and ML (1987-)
- **AI and scientific method**
  - Rigorous methods to test performance
  - E.g., speech recognition, handwritten character recognition
  - Benchmarks for progress, e.g.,
    - MNIST: handwritten digit recognition
    - ImageNet: image object recognition
    - SAT Competitions: boolean satisfiability solvers

- **AI shifts ...**
  - From Boolean logic to probability
  - From hand-coded rules to machine learning
  - From a-priori reasoning to experimental results

* Progress in Speech Recognition
- **1970s: ad-hoc approaches**
  - Various architectures and approaches were attempted
  - Rule-based systems with limited robustness
  - Cons
    - Ad-hoc, fragile
  - _"Every time I fire a linguist, the performance of the speech recognizer goes
    up" (Jelinek, 1988)

- **1980s: hidden Markov Models**
  - HMMs became dominant
  - Effective learning techniques
  - Trained on large speech corpora
  - Pros
    - Strong theoretical foundation

- The bitter lesson (Sutton, 2019)
  - General methods + lots of data beat handcrafted systems

* Bayesian Networks
- **Bayesian networks**
  - Pearl, 1988
  - AI is linked with:
    - Probability
    - Decision theory
    - Control theory
  - Efficiently represent uncertainty
  - Provide rigorous reasoning

- **Examples**
  - Diagnosing diseases based on symptoms
  - Predictive text input in smartphones
  - Fraud detection in banking

* Reinforcement Learning
- **Reinforcement learning**
  - Sutton, 1988
  - RL involves agents learning by interacting with an environment
    - E.g., a robot learning to navigate a maze by receiving rewards for
      successful paths
  - Markov Decision Problems (MDPs) provide a framework for modeling
    decision-making
    - E.g., a game strategy modeled where each move influences the outcome with
      certain probabilities

* Reunification (1990s-2000s)
- **Reunification of AI**:
  - Data engineering
  - Statistical modeling
  - Optimization
  - Machine learning

- **Many subfields of AI were re-unified**:
  - Computer vision
  - Robotics
  - Speech recognition
  - Multi-agent systems
  - NLP

* Big Data (2001-Present)
- **Focus shifts from algorithms to data**
  - For 60 years, AI focused on algorithms and models

- For many problems, data availability matters more than algorithms, e.g.,
  - Trillions of English words
  - Billions of web images
  - Billions of speech and video hours
  - Social network data
  - Click stream data

- Algorithms and infrastructure to leverage large datasets
  - E.g., map reduce, cloud computing

- In 2011, IBM's Watson beat human _Jeopardy!_ champions

* Deep Learning (2011-Present)
- **Deep learning**
  - Use ML models with multiple layers of computing elements
  - Ideas known since 1970s, but then forgot
  - Success in handwritten digit recognition in 1990s

- **In 2012**, a DL system showed dramatic improvement in `ImageNet` competition
  - Previous systems used handcrafted features
  - Surge of interest in AI among researchers, companies, and investors

- Pros
  - DL exceeds human performance in several vision and speech recognition tasks

- Cons
  - DL needs specialized hardware (e.g., GPU, TPU, FGPA) for parallel tensor
    operations

- Towards **general artificial intelligence**
  - Universal algorithm for learning and acting, not just specialized tasks
  - E.g., driving, playing chess, recognizing speech

* Progress in AI Research
- Huge interest in deep learning

- **Between 2010 and 2019**
  - AI papers increased 20x
    - 1,000 $\to$ 20,000
  - Student enrollment in AI and CS increased 5x
    - 10,000 $\to$ 50,000
  - NeurIPS attendance increased 8x
    - 1,000 $\to$ 8,000
  - AI startups increased 20x
    - 100 $\to$ 2,000

- **Compute**
  - Training times dropped 100x in 2 years
  - AI computing power doubles every 3 months

* Solutions to Problem of Control
- **Checks-and-balances**
  - Researchers and corporations develop voluntary self-governance principles for
    AI
  - Governments and international organizations established advisory bodies

- **Cons**
  - Corporations checking themselves? What can possibly go wrong?
  - Preferences are not easy to invert and are inconsistent

- **Solutions**
  - Put purpose into the machine even if objectives are unclear
  - Incentivize AI to switch off if uncertain about human objectives
  - Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CIRL)
    - AI observes human behavior to infer reward function

* Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning
- AI infers human goals based on actions

- **Observation**: GP looks tired, sits on the couch, observes the messy table,
  and starts watching TV

- **Inference**: AI infers:
  - GP is tired and wants to relax
  - Messy coffee table bothers him

- **Action**: AI:
  - Fetches a glass of water
  - Tidies up the coffee table without disturbing GP

- **Feedback loop**: AI monitors GP's reactions
  - If GP is relaxed and happy, AI understanding is reinforced
  - If GP is not happy, AI adjusts actions and improves inference
