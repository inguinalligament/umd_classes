# #############################################################################

* Hierarchical Models
- Aka "multilevel", "nested", "mixed-effects" models

- **Key observation**: data points share structure, but also have variations
  - **Group data**
    - E.g., sales in cities: each city is a market, with common trends
  - **Hierarchical structure**
    - E.g., students in a school: each student is different, with common factors
  - **Repeated measurements on same objects**

- **Idea**: ![](emoji/lightbulb.png){ width=14px }
  - Model shares information between groups, but allows differences
  - Parameters of prior distributions have a prior distribution
    - Aka "hyper-priors" (!)

- You can't do this with frequentist approach, only Bayesian approach

* Hierarchical Models: Examples
- Many data problems lend themselves to **hierarchical descriptions**

- E.g.,
  - Medical research:
    - Estimate drug effectiveness
    - Categorize patients by demographics, disease severity
    - Estimate cure probability for subgroups
  - Market research
    - Understand consumer purchasing behavior
    - Categorize consumers by age, gender, income, education

* Unpooled, Pooled, Hierarchical Models
- **Pooled**
  - Groups have the same priors
- **Unpooled**
  - Groups have different priors
- **Hierarchical**
  - Groups have different priors which come from a common prior

// ## 3.2, Hierarchical shifts

* Hierarchical Models: Chemical Shift
- **Proteins** are made of 20 amino acids
  - Study proteins with nuclear magnetic resonance
  - Measure "chemical shift"

- **Data** looks like:

::: columns
:::: {.column width=40%}
![](msml610/lectures_source/figures/Lesson07_Chemical_shift_hierarchical1.png)
::::
:::: {.column width=45%}
\small
- `ID`: Code of the protein
- `aa`: Name of the amino acid
- `theo`: Theoretical values of chemical shift
- `exp`: Experimental value
- `diff`: Difference between theoretical and experimental value
::::
:::

* Hierarchical Models: Chemical Shift
- Given experimental measures of chemical shifts vs theoretical values, evaluate
  model using different styles
  1. **Pooled**
     - Compute difference between estimates and measures, fit Gaussian
     - More accurate estimates / lose amino acid info
  2. **Unpooled**
     - Fit 20 Gaussians for 20 amino acids
     - Detailed analysis / less accuracy
  3. **Hierarchical**
     - Model groups assuming common population

* Chemical Shift: Unpooled Model

::: columns
:::: {.column width=40%}
- **Model each group independently**
  - Use same model structure to compare groups

* Chemical Shift: Hierarchical Model
::: columns
:::: {.column width=40%}
- **Add two hyperpriors on $\mu$**
  - Mean of $\mu$
  - Standard deviation of $\mu$

- **Assume same variance $\sigma$ for all groups**
  - Modeling choice
  - Option to add hyperpriors for $\sigma$

- Intermediate situation between single group and 20 separate groups

* Chemical Shift: Results
::: columns
:::: {.column width=45%}
- Compare estimates of two models
  - 20 groups
  - Each model has 4 estimated variables

- Plot 94% credible intervals
  - **\blue{Blue}**: hierarchical
  - **\orange{Orange}**: non-hierarchical
  - **\black{Black}** vertical line: global mean (hierarchical model)
  - **\blue{Blue}** means pulled towards mean compared to **\orange{orange}**

- **Shrinkage occurs**

* Shrinkage
::: columns
:::: {.column width=55%}
- **Hierarchical models shrink parameters towards a common mean**
  - Groups share information through the hyper-prior
  - Model groups as neither independent nor a single group
  - Less responsive to extreme values in individual groups
  - Improve estimation for small groups using data from others

![](msml610/lectures_source/figures/Lesson07.3_Shrinkage.png)
::::
:::
- **Amount of shrinkage** depends on data:
  - Groups with more data influence estimates more
  - Similar groups reinforce common estimation
  - Global optimization
- **Result**: inference is more stable

* You Need to Know When to Stop
- You can create **hierarchical models with as many levels** as you want
  - **Pros**:
    - Leverage data structure
  - **Cons**
    - Don't improve inference quality
    - Complicate interpretation

- _"Add as many degrees as freedom as needed, but not more than what is
  warranted"_ (Occam's razor)
